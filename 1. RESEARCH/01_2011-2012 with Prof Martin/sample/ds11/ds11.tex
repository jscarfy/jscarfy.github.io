\begin{abstract}
A Sidon sequence is a sequence of integers $a_1<a_2<\dots$ with the property that the sums $a_i+a_j$ ($i\le j$)
are distinct. This work contains a survey of Sidon sequences and their generalizations, and an extensive
annotated and hyperlinked bibliography of related work.

\section{Introduction}

For a subset $\cA$ of an abelian group (usually $\Z$), define
    $$\cA^\ast(k):=\# \{ (a_1,a_2) \in {\cA} \times {\cA} \colon a_1+a_2=k\}$$
and
    $${\cA}^\circ(k):= \# \{ (a_1,a_2) \in {\cA} \times {\cA} \colon a_1-a_2=k\}.$$

In 1932, Simon Sidon~\cite{1932.Sidon} considered sets of integers with both $\cA^\ast$ and $\cA^\circ$
bounded\footnote{Here is one of his theorems. Suppose that $C$ and $g$ are real numbers. There is a constant
$K=K(C,g)$ such that for every set $\cA$ of positive integers with $\cA^\ast(k)+\cA^\circ(k)\leq g$ (for all
$k>0$) and every sequence $\lambda_a$ with $\sum |\lambda_a|^2\leq C$, there is a function $f:[0,1]\to\C$ which
is bounded by $K$ and $\hat{f}(a)=\lambda_a$ for every $a\in\cA$.}. It is easily shown (and done so in the next
section) that $\cA^\ast(k)\le 2$ for all $k$ if and only if $\cA^\circ(k)\le 1$ for all $k\not=0$. This led
Sidon to ask Erd\H{o}s how large a subset of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ can be with the property that $\cA^\ast(k)\leq 2$
(for all $k$)? Since that time such sets, e.g., $\{1,2,5,7\}$, have been known as Sidon sets. In other words,
$\cA$ is a Sidon set if the coefficients of
    $$\left(\sum_{a\in\cA} z^a \right)^2 $$
are bounded by 2.

Unfortunately, many authors call Sidon sets ``$B_2$ sets'', and harmonic analysts use the term ``Sidon set'' to
mean something entirely different. These two factors make searching the literature rather difficult. In Math
Sci-Net, for example, it is impossible to search for a math expression such as ``$B_2$'', and a search for
``Sidon'' returns almost 700 hits, most concerning the harmonic analysts' Sidon sets. Further, there are
several different notations in use, sometimes making it difficult to compare results. For these reasons, I felt
that it would be useful to compile a complete annotated bibliography with a consistent notation and to lay out
the major avenues of research, past, present and possibly future.

In loose terms, requiring a set to have the Sidon property forces it to be thin, e.g., it cannot contain three
consecutive integers. The most basic question is ``How thick can a Sidon set be?'' There are several ways to
make this question explicit, several different settings to explore, and a variety of generalizations. Having
only partially solved these problems, researchers have recently begun turning their attention to the question
``what is the structure of a maximally thick Sidon set?''



In Section~\ref{sec.Terminology}, we define the relevant sets and counting functions and fix the terminology
used in the annotations. In Section~\ref{sec.Constructions}, we present the known general constructions of
(generalized) Sidon sets. In Sections~\ref{sec.Size} and~\ref{sec.Size2} we give the state-of-the-art results
concerning the density of Sidon sets. In Section~\ref{sec.distribution} we state a few of the results
concerning the structure of Sidon sets and their sumsets. In Section~\ref{sec.SpecialSequences} we discuss the
problem of finding a Sidon subset of a given set, such as Sidon sets whose elements are squares or fifth
powers. In Section~\ref{sec.OpenQuestions} we list some of the major unsolved questions.

Finally, we give a partially annotated bibliography of works which either develop or apply the theory of Sidon
sets. The bibliography is, so far as I know, complete and 100\% accurate. The bibliography is heavily
hyperlinked (so you lose something if you print it out), and the links to Math Sci-Net reviews require a Math
Sci-Net subscription. Please email the author regarding any omissions, additions, errors, or clarifications.

\section{Terminology}\label{sec.Terminology}

We begin by defining a generalized Sidon sequence (with parameters $h$ and $g$) to be a sequence $\cA$ such
that the coefficients of
    \begin{equation}\label{gANDh}
    \bigg(\sum_{a\in\cA} z^a\bigg)^h
    \end{equation}
are bounded by $g$. We note that the coefficient of $z^k$ in \eqref{gANDh}, which we denote $\cA^{\ast h}(k)$,
has a number-theoretic interpretation: it is the number of ways to write $k$ as a sum of $h$ (not necessarily
distinct) elements of $\cA$. Also note that this definition is sensible for $\cA$ a subset of any group $G$.

Our notation $\cA^{\ast h}(k)$ is motivated by the notation for Fourier convolution: for any functions $f,g$,
we have
    \begin{equation*}
    f\ast g(k) = \sum_{x\in G} f(x)\overline{g(k-x)}.
    \end{equation*}
Thus, if $\cA$ is the indicator function of the sequence $\cA$ (a common and useful abuse of notation), then
$\cA^{\ast h}(k)$ is exactly the convolution of $h$ copies of $\cA$ evaluated at $k$: $\cA^{\ast h}(k) = \cA
\ast \dots \ast \cA (k)$. For brevity, we write $\cA^{\ast}$ in place of $\cA^{\ast 2}$. Likewise, we hijack
the notation of Fourier correlation:
    \begin{equation*}
    \cA^\circ(k) = \sum_{x} \cA(x) \cA(k+x) = \#\{(a_1,a_2)\in \cA\times\cA \colon a_2-a_1 = k\}.
    \end{equation*}
While convolution is associative, correlation is not. Thus $\cA^{\circ h}$ is ill-defined; we adopt the
convention $\cA^{\circ h}=\cA^{\circ h-1}\circ \cA$.

\begin{dfn}[$\Bhg{h}{g}$ sequence]
A sequence $\cA$ is a $\Bhg{h}{g}$ sequence if the coefficients of $\left( \sum_{a\in \cA} z^a\right)^h$ are
bounded by $g$. If $\cA\subseteq G \not= \Z$, then we call $\cA$ a $\Bhg{h}{g}(G)$ sequence. In particular, if
$G$ is the additive group of integers modulo $n$, then we speak of $\Bhg{h}{g}\pmod{n}$ sequences. We use the
same notation for the property and for the class of sequences with the property, i.e., if $\cA$ is a
$\Bhg{h}{g}$ sequence then we write $\cA\in \Bhg{h}{g}$.
\end{dfn}

Thus, Sidon sequences are exactly the $\Bhg{2}{2}$ sequences. We note that $\cA^\circ$ is bounded by 1 if and
only if $\cA^\ast$ is bounded by 2. For if $\cA^\circ(k)>1$ (with $k>0$), then there are $a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4 \in
\cA$ with $k=a_1-a_2=a_3-a_4$, and at most two of the $a_i$ are equal. This means that
$a_4+a_1=a_1+a_4=a_2+a_3=a_3+a_2$, so that $\cA^\ast(a_1+a_4)\ge 3$ (it is possible that $a_2=a_3$ or
$a_4=a_1$, but not both). Note however that if $\cA=\{2^k,2^k+1\colon k\geq1\}$, then for all $k$,
$\cA^\ast(k)\leq 4$, while $\cA^\circ(1)=\infty$; and if $\cA=\{\pm 2^k \colon k\geq 1\}$ then
$\cA^\circ(k)\leq 3$ for all $k\not=0$, but $\cA^\ast(0)=\infty$. The upshot is that $\Bhg{2}{2}$ sequences are
not only historically important, but they are qualitatively easier to deal with. In essentially all ways, more
is known about Sidon sequences than about $\Bhg{h}{g}$ sequences with $h>2$ or $g>3$.

We use the notation $[n]:=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Obviously the $\Bhg{h}{g}$ property is invariant under translation
and dilation, so a supposition of the type ``$\cA\subseteq [n]$'' can usually be replaced with ``$\cA$ is a
subset of an arithmetic progression of length $n$''.

\begin{dfn}[$R$ and $C$]
$R_h(g,n)$ is the largest cardinality of a $\Bhg{h}{g}$ sequence contained in $[n]$. $C_h(g,n)$ is the largest
cardinality of a $\Bhg{h}{g}\pmod{n}$ sequence.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[$B_h{[}g{]}$ sequence]
A $B_h[g]$ sequence is a $\Bhg{h}{h!g}$ sequence. If $g=1$, then we speak simply of \Bh{h} sequences.
\end{dfn}

We note that many authors define a $B_h[g]$ sequence to be a $\Bhg{h}{h!(g+1)-1}$ sequence (and so a Sidon
sequence, for these authors, is a sequence for which $\cA^{\ast h}(k)\leq 3$). This is not without reason. If
$k=a_1+\dots+a_h$ and the $a_i$ are distinct, then there are $h!$ rearrangements of the $a_i$ which contribute
to $\cA^{\ast h}(k)$. Since there are asymptotically few $h$-tuples from $\cA \times \dots \times \cA$ that
have repeated $a_i$'s, one expects that there is little distinction (asymptotically) between $\Bhg{h}{h!g}$
sets and $\Bhg{h}{h!(g+1)-1}$ sets. This expectation, however, has not been proven to hold except for $h=2$,
$g=1$.


\section{Constructions}\label{sec.Constructions}
\subsection{The greedy algorithm}
The obvious first attempt at constructing a $B^\ast_h[g]$ sequence is to be greedy. Set $\gamma_1=1$, and
define for each $k\ge 1$ the sequence
 $${\cal G}_k=\{\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \dots, \gamma_k\}$$
where $\gamma_{k}$ is the least $m>\gamma_{k-1}$ such that $\{\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\dots,\gamma_{k}\}$ is a
$B^\ast_h[g]$ sequence. Then
 $${\cal G}_h[g]:= \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty {\cal G}_k$$
is an infinite $B^\ast_h[g]$ sequence.

Mian \& Chowla~\cite{1944.Chowla.Mian} computed the first terms of ${\cal G}_2[2]$ (i.e., the greedy Sidon
sequence, also called the Mian-Chowla sequence) to be 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 21, 31, 45, 66, 81, 97, $\dots$. St\"{o}hr
\cite{1955.Stohr} notes that the Mian-Chowla sequence satisfies $\gamma_k < (k-1)^3+1$. Even for this most
simple case, however, the growth of $\gamma_k$ is not well understood. See~\cite{1988.Jia}. The points $\left(
k, \log_k(\gamma_k)\right)$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:greedyplot}.

% A straightforward pigeonhole calculation gives
% $$\gamma_k \leq ???.$$


\begin{figure}\label{fig:greedyplot}
\begin{picture}(432,270)
    \put(0,0){\includegraphics{greedyplot}}
\end{picture}
\caption{The points $\left( k, \log_k(\gamma_k)\right)$ for the greedy Sidon set ${\cal G}_2[2]$.}
\end{figure}


It is interesting to study the greedy sequence with different seeds. Start by setting
$\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_{r}$, and then continue the sequence in the same manner as above. The resulting sequence
is denoted ${\cal G}_h[g;\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_r]$.

\begin{cnj}\label{cnj.reciprocals}
For any $h$ and $g$, there are not positive integers $r,\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_r$ such that
    $$\inf_{\cA \in \Bhg{h}{g}} \left\{ \sum_{a\in\cA} \frac 1a \right\}$$
is achieved with $\cA={\cal G}_h[g;\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_r]$.
\end{cnj}

This conjecture is dealt with in~\cites{1993.Zhang,2000.Taylor.Yovanof}; it is known that the infimum in
Conjecture~\ref{cnj.reciprocals} (for $g=h=2$) is between $2.16$ and $2.25$.

\subsection{Ruzsa's sets}
A very simple construction of $B_2$ sequences was given by Ruzsa~\cite{1993.Ruzsa}, which is generalized
in~\cite{2004.Martin.OBryant} to $B_2[g^2]$ sequences. Let $\theta$ be a generator of the multiplicative group
modulo the prime $p$. For $k,t\in[p-1]$, let $a_{t,k}$ be the congruence class modulo $p^2-p$ defined by
    \begin{equation*}
    a_{t,k} \equiv t \pmod{p-1} \quad \text{ and } \quad
    a_{t,k} \equiv k \theta^t \pmod{p}.
    \end{equation*}
Define the set
    $$
    \Ruzsa{p}{\theta}{k} := \{a_{t,k} \colon 1\le t < p \} \subseteq \Z/(p^2-p).
    $$
If ${\cal K}$ is any subset of $[p-1]$, then
    $$
    \Ruzsa{p}{\theta}{\cK} := \bigcup_{k\in \cK} \Ruzsa{p}{\theta}{k}
    $$
is a subset of $\Z/(p^2-p)$ with cardinality $|{\cK}|(p-1)$ and
    $$\Ruzsa{p}{\theta}{\cK} \in B_2[|{\cK}|^2].$$

An example is given in Figure~\ref{fig:RuzsaExample}: the row labeled $k$ is $\Ruzsa{13}{2}{k}$. Note that each
row is a translate modulo $13^2-13$ of the row above (and rotated). This is because
    $$a_{t,k\theta}+p\equiv a_{(t+1\bmod{p-1}),k} \pmod{p^2-p},$$
and consequently $\Ruzsa{p}{\theta}{k\theta}+p=\Ruzsa{p}{\theta}{k}$. Since $\theta$ is a generator of the
multiplicative group modulo $p$, this implies that for fixed $p$ and $\theta$ all of the various
$\Ruzsa{p}{\theta}{k}$ are translates of one another.

        $\Ruzsa{13}{2}{k}$.}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Bose's sets}
Bose~\cite{1942.Bose} constructed Sidon sequences by using finite affine geometry. His construction was extended
to $B_h$ sequences (and given in the language of finite fields) in~\cite{1962.Bose.Chowla}, and extended to
$B_2[g^2]$ sequences in~\cite{2004.Martin.OBryant}. Let $q$ be any prime power, $\theta$ a generator of the
multiplicative group of $\GF{q^h}$, and $k \in \GF{q}$, and define the set
    $$
    \Bose{h}{q}{\theta}{k} := \{a \in [q^h-1] \colon \theta^a-k\theta\in \GF{q}\}.
    $$
$\Bose{h}{q}{\theta}{1}$ is $B_h\pmod{q^h-1}$ set, and some work (see~\cite{1945.Bose.Chowla}) has been done on
the question of how quickly these sets can be computed and whether varying $\theta$ (with $h=2$) can help
produce a Sidon set with smaller largest element. If ${\cal K}$ is any subset of $\GF{q}\setminus\{0\}$, then
    $$
    \Bose{2}{q}{\theta}{\cK} := \bigcup_{k\in \cK} \Bose{2}{q}{\theta}{k}
    $$
is a $B_2[|{\cal K}|^2]\pmod{q^2-1}$ sequence.

An example is given in Figure~\ref{fig:BoseExample}, with $q=13$, $h=2$, $\GF{13^2}=\GF{13}[x]/(x^2+2)$, and
$\theta=1+3x$. The column labeled $c_1$ is $\Bose{2}{13}{1+3x\bmod{(13,x^2+2)}}{c_1}$. Note that, as with
Ruzsa's sets, varying $k$ has the effect of translating the set:
    $$\Bose{h}{q}{\theta}{k}=\Bose{h}{q}{\theta}{1}+\log_\theta(k).$$
We note that, unlike Ruzsa's sets, each {\em row} (except the one labeled zero) in Figure~\ref{fig:BoseExample}
is also a Sidon set.

\subsection{Singer's sets}
Sidon sequences arose incidentally in Singer's work~\cite{1938.Singer} on finite projective geometry. While
Singer's construction gives a slightly thicker Sidon set than Bose's (which is slightly thicker than Ruzsa's),
the construction is more complicated --- even after the simplification of~\cite{1962.Bose.Chowla}. Singer's
construction was extended to $B_2[g^2]$ sequences in~\cite{2004.Martin.OBryant}. No computational work has been
published for Singer's sets.

Let $q$ be any prime power, and let $\theta$ be a generator of the multiplicative group of $\GF{q^{h+1}}$. For
each $\vec{k}=\langle k_1,\dots,k_{h} \rangle \in\GF{q}^{h}$ define the set
    $$
    T(\vec{k} ) := \{0\} \cup \left\{ a \in [q^{h+1}-1] \colon
        \theta^a- \sum_{i=1}^{h} k_i \theta^i \in \GF{q} \right\}.
    $$
Then define
    $$
    \Singer{h}{q}{\theta}{\vec k}
    $$
to be the congruence classes modulo $\frac{q^{h+1}-1}{q-1}$ that intersect $T(\vec k)$. Also define
    $$
    \Singer{h}{q}{\theta}{\cK} := \bigcup_{\vec k\in \cK} \Singer{h}{q}{\theta}{\vec k},
    $$
where $\cK$ is any subset of $\GF{q}^h$. The set $\Singer{h}{q}{\theta}{\langle 1,0,0,\ldots \rangle}$ is a
$B_{h}\pmod{\frac{q^{h+1}-1}{q-1}}$ set. The set $\Singer{2}{q}{\theta}{\langle 1,[k],0 \rangle}$ is a
$\Bhg{2}{2k^2}$ set.




\subsection{Erd\H{o}s \& Tur\`{a}n's sets}
Erd\H{o}s \& Tur\`{a}n~\cite{1941.Erdos.Turan} gave a construction based on quadratic residues. These sets are
substantially thinner than the constructions of Ruzsa, Bose, and Singer given above.

Fix a prime $p$, and let $(k^2)$ be the unique integer in $[p-1]$ congruent to $k^2$ modulo $p$. The set
$\{2pk+(k^2) : 1\leq k <p \}$ is a $B_{2}$ set contained in $[2p+1,2p(p-1)+1]$.

\subsection{Probabilistic Sets}
The seminal paper of Erd\H{o}s \& R\'{e}nyi~\cite{1960.Erdos.Renyi} introducing the probabilistic method to
combinatorial number theory contains a small section on $B_{2}{g}$ sets. The crucial observation made is that
(setting $p_n=1/\sqrt{n}$) the sum
    $$\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} p_n p_{N-n}$$
is bounded independent of $N$. In particular, they prove the existence of an infinite $\Bhg{2}{g}$ set
$a_1<a_2<\cdots$ satisfying
    $$a_k=\bigO{k^{2(1+2/(g-1))}}.$$
See the review of~\cite{1960.Erdos.Renyi} for a more detailed explanation.

See~\cites{1996.3.Kolountzakis, 1998.2.Ruzsa, 1999.Godbole.Janson.Locantore.Rapoport,
2000.Baltz.Schoen.Srivastav, 2001.Ruzsa, Nathanson} for some applications of probability to Sidon sequences, and
vice versa.



\section{The size of finite Sidon sequences}\label{sec.Size}

One of the ``most wanted'' problems is to asymptotically estimate $R_h(g,n)$ for any $h,g$ with $h>2$ or $g>3$.
Also on the ``most wanted'' list is a construction of $\Bhg{h}{g}$ sequences, with $g>h!$, which is dense but is
not merely several $B_h$ sets woven together (such sets do exist:~\cite{1980.Erdos}).

We measure the thickness of $\Bhg{h}{g}$ sets with the quantity:
    $$\sigma_h(g):= \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{R_h(g,n)}{\sqrt[h]{\floor{g/h!}n}}.$$
Strictly speaking, this limit is not known to exist for $h>2$ or for $g>3$. One should always understand a
lower bound on $\sigma_h(g)$ as being a lower bound on the corresponding $\liminf$, and an upper bound as being
an upper bound on the $\limsup$. If $g=h!$, then we simply write $\sigma_h$.

There are a number of conjectures that are natural to make:
 \begin{enumerate}
    \item   The limit in the definition of $\sigma_h(g)$ is in fact well-defined.
    \item   For each $h$, $\sigma_h(g)$ is an increasing function of $g$.
    \item   For each $h$, $\lim_{g\to\infty} \sigma_h(g)$ is defined and finite.
    \item   If $kh!\le g_1\le g_2 < (k+1)h!$, then $\sigma_h(g_1)=\sigma_h(g_2)$.
 \end{enumerate}
As basic as these questions may seem, they remain unanswered. Regarding question 3, the limit is known to be
bounded between two positive constants. Sadly, there isn't even a conjecture as to growth of $\sigma_h$ as a
function of $h$ (it may well depend on the parity of $h$).

The only explicit values known are $\sigma_2(2)=\sigma_2(3)=1$.

\subsection{$h=2$}
Erd\H{o}s offered USD 500 for answer to the question, ``Is $R_2(2,n)-\sqrt{n}$ unbounded?'' The answer is
likely ``yes''; it is also likely that $R(2,n)-\sqrt{n}$ is nonnegative. Unfortunately, there has been no
progress on these questions since 1941, when it was found that
    $$-n^{\alpha/2} < R(2,n)-\sqrt{n} < n^{1/4}+1,$$
the lower bound holding only for $n$ sufficiently large, with $\alpha$ being a real number such that there is
always a prime between $n-n^{\alpha}$ and $n$ (the current record is $\alpha=0.525$).

\caption{The best known upper and lower bounds on $\sigma_2(g)$.}
\end{figure}

The best known upper and lower bounds on $\sigma_2(g)$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sigma2}. The lower bound is
$$
\begin{array}{r@{{}\ge{}}l@{{}>{}}l}
    \sigma_2(4)  & \sqrt{8/7}                   & 1.069, \\ \vspace{1mm}

    \sigma_2(10) & \sqrt{49/45}                 & 1.043, \\ \vspace{1mm}
    \sigma_2(12) & \sqrt{6/5}                   & 1.095,
\end{array}
\qquad
\begin{array}{r@{{}\ge{}}l@{{}>{}}l}
    \sigma_2(14) & \sqrt{121/105}               & 1.073, \\ \vspace{1mm}
    \sigma_2(16) & \sqrt{289/240}               & 1.097, \\ \vspace{1mm}
    \sigma_2(18) & \sqrt{32/27}                 & 1.088, \\ \vspace{1mm}
    \sigma_2(20) & \sqrt{40/33}                 & 1.100, \\ \vspace{1mm}
    \sigma_2(22) & \sqrt{324/275}               & 1.085,
\end{array}
$$
and for $g\ge 12$
    $$\sigma_2(2g) \ge \sqrt{2} \frac{g+2\floor{g/3}+\floor{g/6}}{\sqrt{6g^2-2g\floor{g/3}+2g}}.$$
In particular,
    $$\lim_{g\to\infty} \sigma_2(g) \ge \sqrt{121/96} > 1.122.$$
The upper bound is a combination of
    $$\sigma_2(2g) \le \sqrt{\tfrac 74 (2-1/g)}$$
and
$$\frac{\floor{g/2}}{g}\sigma_2(g)^2 \leq
\left\{%
\begin{array}{ll}
    1.74043-{1.00483}/g,
    & \hbox{$g\le8$ and even;} \\
    1.58337-\frac{0.026335}g + \sqrt{0.011572-\frac{0.083397}g+\frac{0.00069356}{g^2}},
    & \hbox{$g\ge 10$ and even;}\\
    1.74043-\frac{4.75492}g,
    & \hbox{$g\le 23$ and odd;} \\
    1.58337-\frac{0.071949}g + \sqrt{0.011572-\frac{0.22784}g+\frac{0.0051768}{g^2}},
    & \hbox{$g\ge 25$ and odd.}
\end{array}%
\right.
$$
In particular,
    $$\lim_{g\to\infty} \sigma_2(g) \le 1.839.$$

For $g=2$, the upper bound is due to Erd\H{o}s \& Tur\`{a}n~\cite{1941.Erdos.Turan} and the upper bound is due to
Singer~\cite{1938.Singer}. For $g=3$, the upper bound is Ruzsa's~\cite{1993.Ruzsa}, and the lower bound is from
$R(g+1,n)\le R(g,n)$. For $g>3$ the upper bound is a combination of Green~\cite{2001.Green} (for small $g$) and
Martin~\& O'Bryant~\cite{Martin.OBryant} (for large $g$). The lower bound for $g=4$ is due to Habsieger \&
Plagne~\cite{2002.Habsieger.Plagne}, the $g=6$ and $g=8$ bounds are due to
\cite{2002.Cilleruelo.Ruzsa.Trujillo}, and for all other even $g$ by Martin \& O'Bryant
\cite{2004.Martin.OBryant}. The lower bounds for odd $g>3$ are just $\sigma_2(2g)\le \sigma_2(2g+1)$.

The proof of $\sigma_2(2) = 1$ is succinct and elegant; we present it momentarily. The upper bound was found
initially in~\cite{1941.Erdos.Turan} and simplified in~\cite{1969.2.Lindstrom}. The lower bound was found in
\cite{1938.Singer} and simplified to this form in~\cite{1993.Ruzsa}.

\begin{thm} The largest Sidon subset of $[n]$ has $\sim \sqrt{n}$ elements, i.e.,
$\sigma_2 = 1$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof} Let $1\le a_1<a_2< \dots < a_r \le n$ be a Sidon sequence, and
consider the differences (the parameter $u$ will be set to $\floor{n^{1/4}}$):
    \begin{center}
    $a_2-a_1, \quad a_3-a_2,\quad \dots,\quad a_r-a_{r-1}$ \\
    $a_3-a_1, \quad a_4-a_2,\quad  \dots, \quad a_r-a_{r-2}$ \\
    $\vdots$ \\
    $a_{u+1}-a_1, \quad a_{u+2}-a_2,\quad  \dots,\quad a_r-a_{r-u}$
    \end{center}
The $k$-th row contains $r-k$ differences, and since $\{a_i\}$ is a Sidon set, these differences are distinct.
That's a total of $\sum_{i=1}^u (r-i) = ru-\frac12 u(u+1)$ differences. The sum of all these differences is at
least
    $$\sum_{i=1}^{ru-u(u+1)/2} i = \frac12\left(ru-\tfrac12 u(u+1)\right)\left(ru-\tfrac12 u(u+1)+1\right).$$
On the other hand, the sum of the differences in the $k$-th row telescopes to
    $$\sum_{i=r-k+1}^r a_i - \sum_{i=1}^k a_i < kn, $$
and so the sum of all the differences is less than $\sum_{k=1}^u kn=nu(u+1)/2$. Comparing the upper and lower
bounds yields an inequality in terms of $n$, $r$, and $u=\floor{n^{1/4}}$. Calculus implies that
$r<n^{1/2}+n^{1/4}+1$, which in turn implies that $\sigma_2 \le 1$.

We now give Ruzsa's construction of a Sidon set contained in $p(p-1)$ with $p-1$ elements ($p$ is any odd
prime), from which it follows (using the elementary fact that the ratio between consecutive primes goes to 1)
that $\sigma_2 \ge 1$. Let $\theta$ be a primitive root modulo $p$, and consider the set $\cA$ of integers
$a_t$ ($1\le t < p-1$) defined by
    $$1\le a_t < p^2-p \quad \text{ and } \quad
    a_t \equiv t \pmod{p-1} \quad\text{ and } \quad
    a_t \equiv \theta^t \pmod{p}.$$
Now suppose, by way of contradiction, that there are three pairs $(a_{r_m},a_{v_m})\in \cA \times \cA$
satisfying $a_{r_m}+a_{v_m}= k $ (for some fixed $k\in\Z$). Each pair gives rise to a factorization modulo $p$
of
    $$x^2 - k x + \theta^k\equiv (x-a_{r_m})(x-a_{v_m}) \pmod{p},$$
using the critical relation $a_{r_m}a_{v_m}\equiv \theta^{r_m+v_m}=\theta^k \pmod{p}$. Factorization modulo $p$
is unique, so it must be that two of the three pairs are congruent modulo $p$, say
    \begin{equation}\label{modp:eq}
    a_{r_1}\equiv a_{r_2} \pmod{p}.
    \end{equation}
In this case, $\theta^{r_1} \equiv a_{r_1}\equiv a_{r_2} \equiv \theta^{r_2} \pmod{p}$. Since $\theta$ has
multiplicative order $p-1$, this tells us that $r_1 \equiv r_2 \pmod{p-1}$. Since $a_{r_m} \equiv r_m
\pmod{p-1}$ by definition, we have
    \begin{equation}\label{modp-1:eq}
    a_{r_1} \equiv a_{r_2} \pmod{p-1}.
    \end{equation}
Equations \eqref{modp:eq} and \eqref{modp-1:eq}, together with $a_{r_1}+a_{v_1} = k = a_{r_2}+a_{v_2}$ imply
that the pairs $(a_{r_1},a_{v_1}), (a_{r_2},a_{v_2})$ are identical, and so there are {\em not} three such
pairs. Thus, $\cA$ is a Sidon set. In particular, $\cA=\Ruzsa{p}{\theta}{1}$.
\end{proof}

A Sidon sequence $a_1<a_2<\dots<a_k$ is called ``short'' if $a_k-a_1$ is as small as possible.
Figure~\ref{fig:SidonSets} contains (up to reflection and translation) all of the short Sidon sequences with
$k\le 10$, and two of the short Sidon sequences with $k=11$; I don't know if there are more. It is rumored that
Imre Ruzsa has computed that $\min\{a_{12}-a_1\} = 85$, $\min\{a_{13}-a_1\}= 106$, $\min\{a_{14}-a_1\}=127$. It
is likely that for each $k$, there is short Sidon set with $a_1=0$ and $a_2=1$, while it seems likely that each
triple $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ is the beginning of only finitely many short Sidon sequences.

Figure~\ref{fig:R(g,n)} gives the values of $n$ for which $R(g,n)-R(g,n-1)=1$. This table was computed using the
easiest algorithm and a small amount of time. I encourage the interested reader (or her students!) to extend it.

The construction given in~\cite{2002.Cilleruelo.Ruzsa.Trujillo} is optimized by choosing $x$ so that
$R(g,x)/\sqrt{gx}$ is maximized. This appears to happen (for each $g$) with a fairly small value of $x$; a
formula would lay to rest further optimization efforts (such as those in
\cites{2002.Habsieger.Plagne,2004.Martin.OBryant}). Even given a perfect optimization, however, it is unlikely
that this construction is optimal in any sense.

\caption{The best known upper and lower bounds on $\sigma_h$.}
\end{figure}

Very little is understood about $B_h$ sets for $h>2$. The construction of Bose \& Chowla~\cite{1962.Bose.Chowla}
show that $\sigma_h\ge 1$, and we know that $\sigma_2=1$. Various improvements on the upper bound on $\sigma_h$
were given in~\cites{1961.Kruckeberg, 1969.3.Lindstrom, 1984.Dyachkov.Rykov, 1986.Shparlinski, 1993.Jia,
1994.Chen, 1996.1.Kolountzakis}

Cilleruelo~\cite{2001.Cilleruelo} proved that $\sigma_3 \le 1.576$, $\sigma_4 \le 1.673$, and for $h>75$,
    $$\sigma_h^h \le \frac 52 \left(\tfrac{15}{4}-\tfrac{5}{4\ceiling{h/2}}\right)^{1/4}
    \frac{(\ceiling{h/2}!)^2}{\sqrt{\ceiling{h/2}}} $$
for odd $h$, and
    $$\sigma_h^h \le \frac 52 \left(\tfrac{15}{4}-\tfrac{5}{2h}\right)^{1/4}
    ((h/2)!)^2 \sqrt{h/2}$$
for even $h$. He does give improvements for $h\in[5,74]$ also.

Ben Green~\cite{2001.Green} has improved these upper bounds and shown
    \begin{align*}
    \sigma_3 &\le (7/2)^{1/3} < 1.519 \\
    \sigma_4 &\le 7^{1/4} < 1.627  \\
    \sigma_h &\le \frac{1}{2e}\left( h + \frac32 \log h + o_h(\log h)\right).
    \end{align*}
Green's bound for $\sigma_h$ ultimately relies on the observation that if $X_i$ are independent random variables
taking values uniformly in a set of integers $\cA$, then the central limit theorem implies that
$X_1+X_2+\dots+X_h$ has a normal distribution (for large $h$). While Green's bound is not given in an effective
form, we presume that this could be done in a straightforward manner.

\subsection{Cyclic groups}

The earliest appearances of Sidon sets were as Monthly problems~\cites{1906.Veblen, 1906.Dickson} asking for
Sidon subsets of $\Z_n$. If $\cA$ is a $\Bhg{h}{g}(\bmod{ m})$ set and $\gcd(k,m)=1$, then so is $k \cA+r=\{ka+r
\colon a\in \cA\}$; we say that $\cA$ and $k\cA+r$ are equivalent. Veblen and Dickson asked for all inequivalent
Sidon subsets of $\Z_n$ for various $n$. The number of inequivalent modular Sidon sets that arise from the
construction of Bose \& Chowla is investigated in~\cites{1963.Halberstam.Laxton,1964.Halberstam.Laxton}.

The constructions of Ruzsa, Bose, and Singer all give {\em modular} Sidon sets. This would seem to be a more
symmetric setting, and so an easier setting. Unfortunately, while the constructions are naturally modular, the
upper bounds on $R_h(g,n)$ sets all seem to fundamentally rely on the {\em asymmetry} of $[n]$. Progress (beyond
the very little in~\cite{2004.Martin.OBryant}) on bounding $C_h(g,n)$ would be a significant contribution.
Here's what is known about $C_2(g,n)$:

\begin{thm} \label{C.upperbound}
    Let $q$ be a prime power, and let $k, g,f,x,y$ be positive integers with $k<q$.
    \renewcommand{\theenumi}{\roman{enumi}}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item   $\binom{C_2(2,n)}{2} \le \floor{\frac n2}$, and in particular $C_2(2,n)\le \sqrt{n}+1$;
    \item   $C_2(3,n) \le \sqrt{n+9/2}+3$;
    \item   $C_2(4,n) \le \sqrt{3n} + 7/6$;
    \item   $C_2(g,n) \le \sqrt{gn}$ for even $g$;
    \item   $C_2(g,n) \le \sqrt{1-\tfrac1g}\sqrt{gn}+1$, for odd $g$.
    \item If $q$ is a prime, then $C_2(2k^2,q^2-q)) \geq k (q-1)$;
    \item $C_2(2k^2,q^2-1) \geq k q$;
    \item $C_2(2k^2,q^2+q+1) \geq kq+1$;
    \item If $\gcd(x,y)=1$, then $C_2(gf,xy)\geq C_2(g,x)C_2(f,y)$;
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\section{The size of infinite Sidon sequences}\label{sec.Size2}

Let $\cA\subseteq \Z$ be a Sidon sequence, and let $A(n)=\#(\cA \cap [n])$. St\"{o}hr~\cite{1955.Stohr} strengthens
an unpublished result of Erd\H{o}s and proved that
    $$\liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{A(n)}{\sqrt{n/\log(n)}}\not=\infty$$
St\"{o}hr also gave Erd\H{o}s's proof that there is a Sidon sequence with
    $$\limsup_{n\to\infty} \frac{A(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \ge \frac 12;$$
this was improved by Kr\"{u}ckeberg~\cite{1961.Kruckeberg} to $1/\sqrt{2}$, and taken to $\Bhg{2}{g}$ sequences by
Cilleruelo \& Trujillo~\cite{2001.Cilleruelo.Trujillo}. In~\cite{1981.Ajtai.Komlos.Szemeredi} a Sidon sequence
is constructed with
    $$A(n)> 10^{-3} (n \log n)^{1/3}$$
for sufficiently large $n$. Erd\H{o}s asked~\cite{1982.Erdos} if there is a sequence $a_1<a_2<\dots$ with $a_k =
\littleo{k^{3-\epsilon}}$ for any positive $\epsilon$; Ruzsa constructed a Sidon sequence with $A(n)\sim
n^{\sqrt{2}-1+\littleo{1}}$.

Sheng Chen~\cite{1993.Chen} conjectures that if $\cA$ is a $B_{h}$ sequence with counting function $A(n)$, then
    $$\liminf_{n\to\infty} A(n) \left(\tfrac{\log n}{n}\right)^{1/h}$$
is finite. See also~\cites{1994.Helm, 1994.Jia, 1993.1.Helm, 1993.2.Helm, 1989.Nash, 1989.Jia, 1996.Chen,
1996.Helm, MR97d:11040}. Neither the results nor the conjectures have been extended to $\Bhg{h}{g}$ sequences.


\section{The distribution of $\cA$ and $\cA+\cA$}\label{sec.distribution}

If $\cA_n\subset [n]$ is a sequence of Sidon sets and $|\cA| \sim \sqrt{n}$, then $\cA_n$ becomes uniformly
distributed in $[n]$ (see~\cite{1991.Erdos.Freud}). Moreover, $\cA_n$ becomes uniformly distributed in
congruence classes modulo $m$ (for any fixed $m$) (see~\cites{1998.2.Lindstrom, 1999.Kolountzakis,
2002.Schoen}). It is shown in~\cite{1994.2.Erdos.Sarkozy.Sos} that if $\cA$ is any finite Sidon sequence, then
the sumset $\cA+\cA$ consists of at least $c|\cA|^2$ intervals (for an unspecified constant $c$). With care this
can be improved to $(|\cA|^2-|\cA|-1)/4$. Extensive computations indicate that if $|\cA| \sim \sqrt{n}$, then
$\cA+\cA$ consists of $\sim |\cA|^2/3$ intervals. Very little is known about the structure of $\cA+\cA$. Must
the size of the longest interval in $\cA+\cA$ go to infinity as $n$ does (with $|\cA|\sim\sqrt{n}$)?

Martin \& O'Bryant~\cite{Martin.OBryant} conjecture that $\Bhg{2}{g}$ sets with maximal size are uniformly
distributed. Current computations are insufficient to extend this conjecture to $\Bhg{h}{g}$ sets.



\section{Restricted Sidon sequences}\label{sec.SpecialSequences}

A well known conjecture~\cite{1994.Guy} states that the fifth powers $0, 1, 32, 243,\dots$ are a Sidon sequence.
Ruzsa~\cite{2001.Ruzsa} shows that there is an $\alpha$ such that $\{n^5+\floor{\alpha n^4}\colon n\ge n_0\}$ is
a Sidon set. Cilleruelo~\cite{1995.Cilleruelo} considered Sidon sequences all of whose terms are squares. Abbot
\cite{1990.Abbott} studied the size of Sidon sequences contained in an arbitrary set of integers with
cardinality $n$ (there is one with size at least $\frac 2{25} \sqrt{n}$).

Lindstr\"{o}m~\cites{1969.1.Lindstrom,1972.Lindstrom} initiated the study of $\Bhg{h}{g}$ sets in group $\Z^d$.

Erd\H{o}s~\cite{1980.Erdos} investigated Sidon subsets of $\Bhg{2}{g}$ sets. Alon \& Erd\H{o}s
\cite{1985.Alon.Erdos} considered the problem of decomposing a finite $\Bhg{2}{g}$ into $B_2$ sets; how many
$B_2$ sets are needed?

\section{Generalizations}

The graph theorist's analogs of Sidon sets are magic and harmonious labelings. See
\cites{1980.1.Graham.Sloane,1980.2.Graham.Sloane}.

The bigger setting for the Sidon question is that of sets which avoid a linear form. Let $L$ be an $m\times n$
matrix of integers. The set $\cA$ is said to avoid $L$ if there are no nontrivial solutions to
$L\vec{a}=\vec{0}$ with $\vec{a}=(a_1,a_2, \dots ,a_n)^T, a_k\in \cA$. Sidon sets are the special case
$L=[1,1,-1,-1]$, sets with 3-term arithmetic progressions are the case $L=[1,-2,1]$, etc. It is surprising that
in such a general setting significant and strong results can be found. Precisely this is done
in~\cites{1972.Komlos.Sulyok.Szemeredi, 1975.Komlos.Sulyok.Szemeredi,1993.Ruzsa}.

\section{Other open questions}\label{sec.OpenQuestions}

If $\cA^\ast$ is bounded, is it necessarily 0 infinitely often? This is equivalent to a USD 500 question of
Erd\H{o}s~\cite{1989.Erdos}: If every positive integer can be written as a sum of two elements of
$\cB\subseteq\N$ (i.e., $\cB$ is a base), must the number of ways to do so go to infinity?

Is there an anti-Freiman theorem: If $|\cA+\cA|/|\cA|^2 > c$, then $\cA$ has a large $\Bhg{2}{g}$ subset, where
$g$ and `large' depend only $c$? This question may be related to the quasi-Sidon sets discussed
in~\cites{1991.Erdos.Freud, Pikhurko}.

$(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\epsilon)\sqrt{n} < R_2(2,n) < \sqrt{n}+\bigO{n^{1/4}}$ for all $n>n_0$.

The lower bound comes from $R_2(2,2p^2)\geq p-1$ ($p$ prime), which is witnessed by $\{2pk+(k^2) \colon 1\leq k
<p \}$, where $(k^2)$ is the unique integer in $[1,p)$ congruent to $k^2$ modulo $p$.

The upper bound (the argument can actually be made to give $R_2(2,n)<n^{1/2}+n^{1/4}+1$) is repeated almost
verbatim as Theorem 4 in~\cite{1983.Halberstam.Roth}*{Chapter II}. Let $S\subset[n]$ be a Sidon set with maximal
cardinality, and let $A_u=|S\cap[-n^{3/4}+u,u)|$. The idea is to bound $\sum \binom{A_u}{2}$ above and below.
The lower bound uses Cauchy's inequality, and the upper bound uses the observation that $(s_i,s_j)\in S\times S$
is determined by $s_i-s_j$, i.e., Sidon sets not only have distinct sums, but distinct differences as well.}

\annotation{This survey addresses Sidon sets in $\S 12 a\beta$ on pages 129--135. Two results of Erd\H{o}s
are given: There is an infinite Sidon set whose counting function $A(n)$ satisfies $\limsup
\frac{A(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \geq \frac12$; Every infinite Sidon set has a counting function $A(n)$ satisfying
$\liminf \frac{A(n)}{\sqrt{n}}=0$.

St\"{o}hr notes that this second result shows that the guess of Mian \& Chowla~\cite{1944.Chowla.Mian} that the
$n$-th term of the greedy Sidon set is at most $n^2$ is false. He also notes that the second statement (and its
proof) can be made more precise: Every infinite Sidon set has a counting function $A(n)$ satisfying $\liminf
\frac{A(n)\sqrt{\log n } }{\sqrt{n}} \ll 1$. These results are also reported as Theorems 8 and 9 of
\cite{1983.Halberstam.Roth}*{Chapter II}.

St\"{o}hr then raises the question of how large $\liminf \frac{A(n)\sqrt{\log n } }{\sqrt{n}}$ can be, and
if the answer is 0, then what would be a suitable replacement for $\frac{\sqrt{\log n}}{\sqrt{n}}$. He
also asks if there is a Sidon set for which $0< \liminf \frac{A(n)\sqrt{\log n } }{\sqrt{n}}\leq \limsup
\frac{A(n)\sqrt{\log n } }{\sqrt{n}}<\infty$. Similar questions are raised for $B_h$ sets.

St\"{o}hr then considers the greedy Sidon set, and notes that its $n$-th element $a_n$ is at most $(n-1)^3+1$.}

\annotation{This papers examines the behavior of $S^\ast(n)$ for sets $S$ defined by $\Prob(k\in S)=p_k$, for
various sequences $p_k$. The result relating to Sidon sequences states that for every $\delta>0$, there exists
a $B^\ast[g]$ sequence $\{a_1,a_2,\dots\}$ satisfying $a_k=\bigO{k^{2(1+2(g-1)^{-1})}}$.

We give the main steps of the proof. Set $p_n=n^{-\frac12-\epsilon}$ (with $\epsilon > (g+1)^{-1}$) and
$q_n=1-p_n$. Define the independent random variables $X_n$ to be 1 with probability $p_n$ and 0 with
probability $q_n$. Define the random function $f(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{n/2} X_kX_{n-k}$; we wish to show that
almost surely $f(n) \leq \frac{g}{2}$ (with finitely many exceptions). Then
 \begin{align*}
    \E[\exp(t f(n) )] &=\prod_{k\leq n/2} \left(1+
        \frac{e^t-1}{(k(n-k))^{1/2+\epsilon}}\right) \\
                    & \leq \prod_{k \leq n/2} \exp \left(
                        \frac{e^t-1}{(k(n-k))^{1/2+\epsilon}}\right) \\
                    &\leq
                        \exp\left(\frac{e^t-1}{n^{2\epsilon}}I(\epsilon)\right),
 \end{align*}
where $I(\epsilon)$ is a constant depending only on $\epsilon$ as $n\to\infty$. Set
$t=\log(1+n^{2\epsilon})$ and apply the Exponential Chebyshev Theorem to find (with $K=g/2$):
    $$\Prob(f(n) > K) \leq \frac{\E[\exp(t f(n))]}{\exp(t(K+1))} \leq \frac{C_1}{n^{2\epsilon(K+1)}}.$$
Thus $\sum_{n=1}^\infty P(f(n) > K)$ converges, and the Borel-Cantelli Lemma guarantees that $\{n \colon
X_n=1\}$ is almost surely a $B^\ast[g]$ sequence (at least, after deleting finitely many terms).

This, and other results of this paper, are given in~\cite{1983.Halberstam.Roth}*{Chapter 3}.}

\authorsabstract{This paper first considers several types of {\em additive bases}. A typical problem is to find
$n_\gamma(k)$, the largest $n$ for which there exists a set $\{0=a_1<a_2<\dots<a_k\}$ of distinct integers
modulo $n$ such that each $r$ in the range $0\le r\le n-1$ can be written {\em at least} once as $r\equiv
a_i+a_j$ (modulo $n$) with $i<j$. For example $n_\gamma(8)=24$, as illustrated by the set $\{0,1,2,4,8,13, 18,
22\}$. The other problems arise if {\em at least} is changed to {\em at most}, or $i<j$ to $i\le j$, of if the
words modulo $n$ are omitted. Tables and bounds are given for each of these problems. Then a closely related
graph labeling problem is studied. A connected graph with $n$ edges is called {\em harmonious} if it is
possible to label the vertices with distinct numbers (modulo $n$) in such a way that the edge sums are also
distinct (modulo $n$). Som infinite families of graphs (odd cycles, ladders, wheels, $\cdots$) are shown to be
harmonious while others (even cycles, most complete or complete bipartite graphs, $\cdots$) are not. In fact
most graphs are not harmonious. The function $n_\gamma(k)$ is the size of the largest harmonious subgraph of
the complete graph on $k$ vertices.}

Let $f(k)$ denote the largest integer $n$ for which there exists a set $\{0=a\sb 1<a\sb 2<\cdots<a\sb
k\}$ of distinct integers modulo $n$ such that each integer $r$ in the range $0\leq r\leq n-1$ can be
written in at least one way in the form $r\equiv a\sb i+a\sb j$ (modulo $n$), $i<j$. Seven other
functions arise if one (i) omits the words "modulo $n$", or (ii) replaces "$i<j$" by "$i\leq j$", or
(iii) changes "at least" to "at most" and "largest" to "smallest". Some of these functions have been
investigated extensively over a number of years and a very large literature has arisen. However, $f$ and
the function $g$ which is obtained from it via (iii) do not seem to have been studied previously.

In Section 2 of the first paper under review a brief account of the history of these eight functions is
given, with particular emphasis on upper and lower bounds and asymptotic estimates. For the functions
$f$ and $g$ the following estimates are given:
    $\frac 5{18}(k-1)\sp 2<f(k)\leq( \smallmatrix k \\ 2\endsmallmatrix )$
and
    $k\sp 2-O(k)<g(k)\leq k\sp 2+O(k\sp {36/23})$.
The lower bound for $f$ is obtained from a result of N. Hammerer and G. Hofmeister [J. Reine Angew. Math.
286/287 (1976), 239--247; MR 54:10181] concerning one of the related functions. The lower bound for $g$ is
obtained via an adaptation of an argument of P. Erd\H{o}s and P. Tur\`{a}n~\cite{1941.Erdos.Turan}, and the upper
bound arises from Singer difference sets and the most recent results on gaps between consecutive primes.

The authors' interest in the function $f$ is motivated by the following consideration: A graph $G$ with $v$
nodes and $e\geq v$ edges is said to be harmonious if it is possible to label the nodes $x$ of $G$ with
distinct elements $\lambda(x)$ of $Z\sb e$ in such a way that when the edge $xy$ is labeled
$\lambda(x)+\lambda(y)$, the resulting edge labels are distinct. It is an immediate result that $f(v)$ is the
greatest number of edges in any harmonious graph on $v$ nodes. Harmonious graphs, in turn, are related to other
combinatorial problems. For example, the problem of assigning communication channels in a network of
transmitting stations, each of which must be able to communicate with several others, may be solved most
efficiently when the underlying graph has a harmonious labeling.

A central question is that of determining which graphs are harmonious. A simple characterization of
harmonious graphs cannot be expected; in fact, the authors conjecture that there is no polynomial-time
algorithm which will determine whether a graph $G$ is harmonious. In Section 4 several general
properties of harmonious graphs are given. These deal mainly with operations that yield new harmonious
graphs from old and with establishing conditions (on $v$ and $e$) that a harmonious graph must satisfy.
In Sections 5--13, various classes of graphs are shown to be harmonious; for example, all odd cycles,
the friendship graph $F\sb n$ consisting of $n$ triangles with a common node, $n\not\equiv 2
(\text{mod}\,4)$, the fan $f\sb n$ obtained by joining each node of a path of length $n$ to a further
node, and all wheels are harmonious. In addition certain graphs are shown to be not harmonious, for
example, the even cycles and the complete bipartite graphs. An interesting open question here is whether
all trees are harmonious. The authors have verified that all trees on at most nine vertices are
harmonious and show that all trees in certain infinite classes are harmonious. Note: For a tree, since
$e=v-1$, one has to modify the definition slightly by allowing one node label to be repeated. In Section
14 the authors prove that almost all graphs are not harmonious. They conclude with the following
unsolved problem: Does $\lim\sb {v\rightarrow\infty}(f(v)/v\sp 2)$ exist? If so, its value, from the
bounds on $f$, lies between $\frac 5{18}$ and $\frac 1{2}$. The corresponding problem for the so-called
graceful graphs has been solved in the affirmative, although the value of the limit is not known.

The function $g$ arises in connection with the following problem in the theory of error-correcting
codes: What is the largest possible number $A(k,2d,w)$ of binary vectors each containing $w$ l's and
$k-w$ 0's such that any two vectors differ in at least $2d$ places? In an earlier paper [IEEE Trans.
Inform. Theory IT-26 (1980), no. 1, 37--43; MR 81d:94026] the authors showed that $A(k,6,w)\geq(1/g(k))(
\smallmatrix k \\ w \endsmallmatrix )$ which, with the estimate for $g(k)$ quoted earlier, gives, for
each fixed $w$, $A(k,6,w)\geq(1+o(1))k\sp {w-2}/w!$, as $k\rightarrow\infty$, a lower bound which is
sharper than any previously known. One can get similar bounds for $A(k,2d,w)$ by using sets in which all
sums of $d-1$ distinct elements are distinct modulo $v$.

The second paper under review is a survey article which summarizes some of the developments that have
arisen. In addition, the second paper contains a survey of the results on harmonious graphs.}

codes and to harmonious graphs. A graph $G=(V,E)$ is harmonious if it is possible to label the $|V|$ vertices
with distinct values from $\Z_{|E|}$ so that every element of $\Z_{|E|}$ occurs uniquely as an edge sum of $G$.
The connection to Sidon sets is that  $\cA$ is Sidon set (modulo $\tbinom {|\cA|}{2}$)  exactly if the vertices
of the complete graph $K_{|\cA|}$ can be labeled (with distinct labels from $\cA$) so that the edge sums are

possible value of $SN$ is $\sqrt 2$, and that of $IX$ is $\infty$. (5) $IN> 2\sp {-1/4}-\varepsilon$ is
obtainable for any $\varepsilon>0$. (6) For any $\varepsilon>0$ there exist $A,B$ with $SP>2-\varepsilon$ and
$IN>0, SX<\infty$, but $SP=2$ implies $IN=0$ and $SX=\infty$. (7) If $IN>0$ then neither $A(x)/\sqrt x$ nor
$B(x)/\sqrt x$ can tend to a limit. Further generalizations are promised in a future paper.}

of positive integers. One defines its counting function as $A(n)={\rm Card}\{a\in A;a\leq n\}$
$(n=0,1,2,\cdots)$, and the representation functions $R\sb 1(n)$, $R\sb 2(n)$, $R\sb 3(n)$ $(n=0,1,2, \cdots)$,

$a<a'$, $a\in A$, $a'\in A$, (3) $n=a+a'$, $a\leq a'$, $a\in A$, $a'\in A$, respectively. Of course, for any
$n\geq 0$, $R\sb 1(n)=R\sb 2(n)+R\sb 3(n)$, and $R\sb 3(n)$ is equal either to $R\sb 2(n)+1$, if $n$ is even
and $n/2$ belongs to $A$, or to $R\sb 2(n)$, otherwise.

2, 347--357; MR 86j:11015; Part II, Acta Math. Hungar. 48 (1986), 201--211; MR 88c:11016; Part III, the
authors, Studia Sci. Math. Hungar. 22 (1987), no. 1, 53--63], regularity properties of the asymptotic behavior
of the function $R\sb 1$ were studied. In Parts IV and V the authors study monotonicity properties of the three
functions $R\sb 1,R\sb 2,R\sb 3$.

In Part IV, they prove first that the function $R\sb 1$ is monotone increasing from a certain point on
(i.e., there exists an $n\sb 0$ with $R\sb 1(n+1)\geq R\sb 1(n)$ for $n\geq n\sb 0$) if and only if the
sequence $A$ contains all the integers from a certain point on. The proof uses elementary but complex
considerations on counting functions.

Secondly, they show that $R\sb 2$ has a different behavior, by exhibiting a class of sequences $A$
satisfying $A(n)<n-cn\sp {1/3}$ for all large $n$ and such that $R\sb 2$ is monotone increasing from
some point onwards.

The third result proved in Part IV is that if $A(n)=o(n/\log n)$ then the functions $R\sb 2$ and $R\sb
3$ cannot be monotone increasing from a certain point on. Here, the proof is based on analytic
properties of the generating function $f(z)=\sum\sb {a\in A}z\sp a$ $(\vert z\vert <1)$, corresponding
to the sequence $A$.

Part V treats the monotonicity of $R\sb 3$. The main result is as follows: If (4) $\lim\sb
{n\to+\infty}(n-A(n))/\log n=+\infty$, then $$\limsup\sb {N\to+\infty}\sum\sp N\sb {k=1}(R\sb 3(2k)-R\sb
3(2k+1))=+\infty.$$ (Thus, roughly speaking, $a\sb i+a\sb j$ assumes more even values than odd ones.)

This theorem implies, firstly, that under hypothesis (4), which is weaker than $A(n)=o(n/\log n)$, $R\sb
3$ cannot be monotone increasing from a certain point on, and, secondly, that if $A$ is an infinite
"Sidon sequence" (also called a "$B\sb 2$-sequence", i.e., a sequence such that $R\sb 3(n)\leq 1$ for
all $n$), then there are infinitely many integers $k$ such that $2k$ can be represented in the form
$2k=a+a'$, $a\in A$, $a'\in A$, but $2k+1=a+a'$, $a\in A$, $a'\in A$, is impossible.

Part V finishes with the construction of a sequence showing that the main result is almost best
possible.

The proofs in Part V are of the same nature as those in Part IV.}

\annotation{The system is roughly as follows. Choose a prime power $q$ around 200, $h$ around 25, $k\in\GF{q}$,
and a generator $\theta$ of the multiplicative group of $\GF{q^h}$. Publish $\Bose{h}{q}{\theta}{k}$ in sorted
order $a_1<\dots<a_p$ as Alice's public key. Bob can send a message to Alice by first encoding it as a vector
$\vec{x}$ of $p$ nonnegative integers with sum $h$, and sending the sum $\vec{x}\cdot \langle
a_1,\dots,a_p\rangle$. Alice can decode this by using her private information: $\theta$ and $k$. Their are
additional contortions recommended to disguise $\theta$ and $k$.

This knapsack cryptosystem was superior to earlier knapsacks in that there was greater density, increasing the
information per bit and fortifying against certain attacks. The Chor-Rivest cryptosystem is simplified in
\cite{1991.Lenstra} (and renamed the powerline cryptosystem), and broken in~\cite{1995.Schnorr.Horner} and
\cite{2001.Vaudenay} using LLL.}

$\bold A$ is called a $B_h[g]$ sequence if $r_h(n, A)\leq g$ for all $n$. Suppose $\bold A$ is contained in
$\{1,\cdots,N\}$, which implies $r_h(n, A)=0$ for $n>hN$. If $\bold A$ is $B_h[g]$ then $r_h(n, A)\leq g$ for
the other $n$'s and we have $\sum r_h(n,\bold A)\leq ghN$. On the other hand this sum is the number of
$h$-tuples of $\bold A$ with repetition allowed and thus $\sum r_h(n,\bold A)\geq|\bold A|^h/h!$. Comparing
these inequalities one can get $|\bold A|\leq(ghh!N)^{1/h}$. The author uses three different methods to get
upper bounds for $|\bold A|$, but only one of them leads to a better result than the above. Some connections

\annotation{This nicely written article begins with a proof that a Sidon subset of $[n]$ with $\sqrt{n}$
elements is uniformly distributed as $n\to \infty$. This is used to study how unbalanced the sumset ${\cal
S}=\{a_i+a_j \colon a_i,a_j \in \cA\}$ of a Sidon set $\cA\subseteq[n]$ (not necessarily maximal) can be. They
show that $\#({\cal S} \cap [n])$ cannot be larger than $n/\pi$ (as $n\to\infty$), but can be as large as
$n(1-1/\sqrt{2})$. This improves the trivial bounds of $n/2$ and $n/4$ to $0.318n$ and $0.293n$.

The authors then consider a couple of generalizations of Sidon sets, the most interesting being that of a {\em
quasi-Sidon sequence}, i.e., a sequence of $\cA$ integers whose sumset ${\cal S}$ has cardinality
$(1+\littleo{1}) \tbinom{|\cA|}{2}$. Loosely, $\cA^\ast(x)\le 2$ for almost all integers $x$. They note that a
quasi-Sidon subset of $[n]$ can have cardinality $\sim \sqrt{4n/3}$, but cannot have cardinality
$\sim\sqrt{3.93n}$. Curiously, if one uses the ``distinct difference'' description of Sidon sets, then the
corresponding quasi-Sidon sets cannot be substantively larger than a classic Sidon set.}

Then, for any $\varepsilon>0$, for large enough $n$ the inequality $1-1/\sqrt 2-\varepsilon\le S(n)/n\le
1/\pi+\varepsilon$ holds. The number $\pi$ enters the problem since $\pi/4$ is the smallest solution of $\sin

the counting function $A(n)$ of a $B\sb r$-sequence $A$ satisfies $\liminf\sb {n\to\infty}A(n)/n\sp {1/r}=0$.
The conjecture was proved for $r=2$ by Erdos himself [see A. St\"{o}hr, J. Reine Angew. Math. 194 (1955), 40--65,
111--140; MR 17, 713] and in the cases $r=4$ and $r=6$ by J. C. M. Nash [Canad. Math. Bull. 32 (1989), no. 4,

\mathreview{B. Garrison}{Let $A$ be an increasing sequence of natural numbers. This sequence is called an
asymptotic basis of order $h$ of $N$ if every sufficiently large $n\in N$ can be written as the sum of $h$
elements of $A$. Let $r_n(h,A)$ denote the number of representations of $n$ as $n=a_1+\cdots+a_h$ with
$a_1,\cdots,a_h\in A$ and $a_1\leq\cdots\leq a_h$. If $A$ satisfies $r_n(h,A)\leq g$ for all $n\in N$, where
$g$ is a natural constant, then $A$ is called a $B_h[g]$-sequence. P. Erd\"{o}s and P. Tur\`{a}n
\cites{1941.Erdos.Turan,1944.Erdos} conjectured that there does not exist a sequence which is both an
asymptotic basis of order 2 of $N$ and a $B_2[g]$-sequence. Erd\"{o}s showed that if
$\liminf_{n\to\infty}A(n)/\sqrt n>0$ and $h_A(m)$ is defined to be $|\{(a_i,a_j)\colon\;a_i,a_j\in A\cap
[1,N^2]$, $m=a_j-a_i\}|$ for a given natural number $N$, then $\sum^N_{m=1}h_A(m)\gg N\log N$. This proves the
conjecture for $g=1$. It is here proved that there exists an infinite sequence $A$ of natural numbers such that
$\liminf_{n\to\infty}A(n)/\sqrt n>0$ and $\sum^N_{m=1}h_A(m)\ll N\log N$. It is a corollary of this theorem
that there exist two increasing sequences $B$ and $M$ of natural numbers with $\liminf_{n\to\infty}B(n)/\sqrt
n>0$, $\liminf_{n\to\infty}M(n)/\sqrt n>0$, and $\delta_B(m)=1$ for all $m\in M$, where
$$\delta_B(m)=|\{(b_i,b_j)\colon\;b_i,b_j\in B,\; m=b_j-b_i\}|.$$}

\mathreview{}{As the title indicates, the paper reports on some problems, old and newer ones, some of them
hopeful, a few of them still intractable, and also on many results concerning the problems. In the paper many
mathematicians contributing to the problems are mentioned but, of course, Erdos has been actively involved in
each of them and most of them are due to him.  Among the problems, six are in the number theory section of the
paper, eight in the combinatorics section and five in the geometry section. Here are three, one from each
section. A sequence of integers $A\colon = \{a\sb 1<a\sb 2<\cdots<a\sb l\leq n\}$ is called a Sidon sequence if
$a\sb i+a\sb j$ are all distinct. Let $g(n)\colon = \max l$. Erdos and P. Turan proved that $g(n)<\sqrt n+cn\sp
{1/4}$. Prove or disprove that for every $\epsilon>0$ the equality $g(n)=\sqrt n+o(n\sp {\epsilon})$ holds.
The basic reference on Sidon sequences is the classical book by H. Halberstam and K. F. Roth [Sequences. Vol.
I, Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, 1966; MR 35:1565]. (Erdos offers USD 500 for the solution of this problem.)  A
recent conjecture of a combinatorial type: For every $k$ there is a graph every vertex of which has degree
$\geq k$, but there is no cycle of length a power of 2. (This conjecture is due to A. Gyarfas and Erdos, and,
to quote the paper, "perhaps is not very difficult".) Finally, a geometrical problem, a 60-year-old conjecture
of Erdos, reads as follows. Let $n$ non-overlapping squares with side lengths $a\sb 1,a\sb 2,\cdots,a\sb n$ be
contained in the unit square. Let $f(n)\colon = \max\sum\sb {i=1}\sp na\sb i$. As Erdos remarks, it is easy to
see that $f(n\sp 2)=n$. The question: Is the relation $f(n\sp 2+1)=n$ true or not?

To all problems many explanations, hints and partial results as well as personal opinions of Erdos are
attached.  Well, while the name of Paul Erdos is well known all over the world, the same cannot be said
of the journal where the paper appeared: Mathematica Pannonica. This is a journal published in the part
of the world that was called ``Pannonia'' in Roman times.}

\annotation{This article gives bounds for the number of intervals in the sumset of a Sidon set. Define
    $${\cal B}({\cal A}+{\cal A},d):= \{s \colon s-d\not\in {\cal A}+{\cal A}, s\in{\cal A}+{\cal A}\},$$
and denote its counting function by ${\cal B}({\cal A}+{\cal A},d,n)$. The following theorems are proved:
Theorem 1: There is an absolute constant $c_1>0$ such that for every finite Sidon set ${\cal A}$ and integer
$d>0$, $$|{\cal B}({\cal A}+{\cal A},d)|>c_1 |{\cal A}|^2.$$ Theorem 2: There is an absolute constant $c_2$
such that for every Sidon set ${\cal A}$ and integer $d>0$,
    $$\limsup_{N\to\infty}\frac{{\cal B}({\cal A}+{\cal A},d,n)}{A^2(N)}>c_2>10^{-7}.$$
Theorem 3: For $n>n_0$, there is a Sidon set in $[n]$ whose sumset does not contain a gap of length
$3\sqrt{n}$. Theorem 4: $\forall \epsilon>0$ there is a Sidon set (let $s_1<s_2<\dots$ be its sumset) and
integer $i_0$ such that $\forall i>i_0$
    $$s_{i+1}-s_i < s_i^{\frac12}(\log s_i)^{\frac32+\epsilon}.$$
Theorem 5: There is an absolute constant $c_4>0$ such that if ${\cal A}$ is a finite Sidon set with $|{\cal
A}|\geq 2$ and sumset $s_1<s_2<\dots<s_u$, then
    $$\max_{1\leq i < u} (s_{i+1}-s_i) > c_4 \log|{\cal A}|.$$


I remark that with a little care one may prove the inequality
    $$|{\cal B}({\cal A}+{\cal A},d)|\geq\tfrac14( |{\cal A}|^2-|{\cal A}|-1)$$
in Theorem 1, and one may take $c_2=\frac1{62}> 0.0162$.

The paper concludes with some interesting open problems. Does the number of ``length one'' intervals in the
sumset of a finite Sidon set go to infinity as the size of the set does? Does
    $$\tfrac {1}{t} \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} (s_{i+1}-s_i)^2 \to \infty$$
where $s_1<s_2<\dots<s_t$ is the sum set of a finite Sidon set? If ${\cal A}$ is a dense finite Sidon set,
must ${\cal A}+{\cal A}$ be well-distributed w.r.t. small moduli?}

\authorsabstract{The authors give a survey of their papers on additive properties of general sequences and they
prove several further results on the range of additive representation functions and on difference sets. Many
related unsolved problems are discussed.}

\mathreview{Georges Grekos}{In the first half of the paper, the authors give a very useful account of their
results, which have been published in a series of papers (see the last two [Monatsh. Math. 102 (1986), no. 3,
183--197; MR 88i:11011b; Israel J. Math. 90 (1995), no. 1-3, 221--233]).  An example of the results: A set $A$
of nonnegative integers is called a Sidon set if for any positive integer $n$ the number of pairs $(a,a\sp
\prime)$ belonging to $A\sp 2$ such that $a\leq a\sp \prime$ and $a+a\sp \prime=n$ is 0 or 1.  The authors
prove (Theorem 10, p. 81) that there is an infinite Sidon set $A$ such that for all $n>n\sb 0,
(A+A)\cap\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$ contains a block consisting of more than ${\frac{1}{50}}n\sp {1/3}$ consecutive
integers. Here $A+A=\{a+a\sp \prime: a\in A, a\sp \prime\in A\}$. Many open problems are also stated. Example
(Problem 14, p. 82):  Does there exist an infinite Sidon set $A$ such that, for all sufficiently large $n$, the
equation $a+a\sp \prime+a\sp {\prime\prime}=n,\ (a,a\sp \prime,a\sp {\prime\prime})\in A\sp 3$, has at least
one solution?

In the second half of the paper, the authors study the set of differences $D(A)=\{a\sp \prime-a: (a,a\sp
\prime)\in A\sp 2, a<a\sp \prime\}$ of the set $A$.  They prove theorems establishing the existence of sets
$A$ such that $D(A)$ is equal to a given set satisfying specific conditions. Another result reads as follows
(Theorem 17, p. 93): Assume that $D(A)=D(B), 0\in A\cap B$, and that for any $n$ the equation $a+a\sp
\prime+a\sp {\prime\prime}=n, (a,a\sp \prime,a\sp {\prime\prime})\in A\sp 3, a\leq a\sp \prime\leq a\sp
{\prime\prime}$, has at most one solution; then $A=B$.  Proofs in the second half are of a combinatorial
nature.}

\mathreview{Ti Zuo Xuan}{A sequence of natural numbers $A$ is called a $B\sb h$-sequence if for every natural
number $n$, $n=a\sb 1+\cdots +a\sb h$ $(a\sb 1\leq\cdots \leq a\sb h$, $a\sb i\in A)$ has at most one solution.
Erdos suggested that the counting function $A(n)$ of the $B\sb h$-sequence $A$ satisfies $\liminf\sb
{n\to\infty}A(n)/n\sp {1/h}=0$, which was proved in the case $h=2$ by him [see A. St\"{o}hr, J. Reine Angew. Math.
194 (1955), 111--140; MR 17, 713a] and for $h=4$ and $h=6$ by Nash and Jia, respectively.

Recently, Jia proved that every $B\sb {2k}$-sequence $A$ satisfies (1) $\liminf\sb {n\to\infty}A(n)/n\sp
{1/h}(\log n)\sp {1/h}<\infty$, where $h=2k$, provided that $A(n)\sp 2\ll (A(n))\sp 2$. However, it is
still an open problem to prove that (1) holds for every $B\sb {2k}$-sequence $A$. (One expects even all
$B\sb h$-sequences to satisfy (1).) More recently, the author [Acta Arith. 63 (1993), no. 4, 367--371;
MR 95c:11029] achieved the same result independently.

In the paper under review, the author proves the following theorem. Let $A$ be a $B\sb {2k}$-sequence.
Then $$\liminf\sb {n\to\infty}\frac{A(n)}{n\sp {1/2k}}(\log n)\sp {1/(3k-1)}<\infty.\hfill (2)$$ This
improves a result of Chen, who proved that (2) holds if the exponent $1/(3k-1)$ is replaced by
$1/(4k-2)$.}

\authorsabstract{We give an algorithm for the enumeration of a set $E$ of nonnegative integers with the property
that each nonnegative integer $x$ can be written as a sum of two elements of $E$ in at least $C_1 log x$ and at
most $C_2 log x$ ways, where $C_1, C_2$ are positive constants. Such a set is called a basis and its existence
has been established by Erd\H{o}s. Our algorithm takes time polynomial in $n$ to enumerate all elements of $E$
not greater than $n$. We accomplish this by derandomizing a probabilistic proof which is slightly different
than that given by Erd\H{o}s.}

\mathreview{Georges Grekos}{Let $E$ be a subset of ${N}\sb 0=\{0,1,2,\cdots\}$. For $x$ belonging to ${N}\sb
0$, let $r(x)$ denote the number of representations of $x$ as $x=a+b$ with $a\in E, b\in E, a\leq b$. The set
$E$ is called an asymptotic basis if $r(x)>0$ for all large $x\in{N}\sb 0$. In known bases $r(x)$ was "small"
(equal to 1) for infinitely many values of $x$ and "big" for the remaining, also infinitely many, values of
$x$. Thus the problem of the existence of bases having a smoothly increasing function $r(x)$ was raised by S.
Sidon.

P. Erd\H{o}s proved that there are positive constants $C\sb 1$ and $C\sb 2$ and a set $E$ such that for all
sufficiently large $x$, (1) $C\sb 1\log\,x\leq r(x)\leq C\sb 2\log\,x$. Erdos' proof is probabilistic. He
proved that the family $\cal F$ of sets $E\subset{N}\sb 0$ having the required properties is not empty, by
showing that, for some probability measure, this family $\cal F$ has positive measure. The author of the
paper under review observes that such a probabilistic proof can be "derandomized" by using conditional
probabilities [N. Alon and J. H. Spencer, The probabilistic method, Wiley, New York, 1992; MR 93h:60002 (p.
223)]. Since $\cal F$ is nonempty, there is some set $E$ in $\cal F$, and given $n\in{N}\sb 0$, one can
decide after $f(n)$ operations whether $n$ belongs to $E$ or not. The author first gives a modified
probabilistic proof of (1). Then he describes the $f(n)$-time algorithm and he proves that $f(n)$ increases
like a polynomial, while Erdos' proof would give an algorithm taking exponential time.}

$\{1,2,\cdots, n\}\sp d$ with distinct Euclidean distances. It is shown that $f\sb 2(n)\geq cn\sp {2/3}$, and
for $d\geq 3$, $f\sb d(n)\geq c\sb dn\sp {2/3}(\ln n)\sp {1/3}$, improving earlier results of Erdos and Guy. To
show this, an anti-Ramsey theorem for totally multicolored subgraphs in edge-coloured complete graphs is
proved, and also number-theoretic results on the number of representations of integers as sums of squares,
using elementary geometry and the circle-method.

It is shown that a set of $n$ points in the plane contains a subset with distinct distances of size
$cn\sp {1/4}$, and of size $c'n\sp {1/3}$ for sets in general position (no 3 points on a line). As
auxiliary results the following are shown: Let the $t$ distinct distances in the set have multiplicities
$m\sb 1,m\sb 2,\cdots, m\sb t$; then $\sum\sp t\sb {i=1}m\sp 2\sb i\leq cn\sp {13/4}$, whereas for sets
in general position the tight bound $\sum\sp t\sb {i=1}m\sp 2\sb i\leq c'n\sp 3$ holds, this being a
conjecture of Erdos and Fishburn.

Algorithmic aspects of the above selection problem are discussed. In particular, an algorithm is
described that finds a subset with distinct distances of the above sizes with time complexity $O(n\sp
{13/4})$ for arbitrary sets and $O(n\sp 3)$ for sets in general position.

A new lower bound of $cn\sp {2/3}$ on the size of a Sidon set in $\{1\sp 2,2\sp 2,\cdots, n\sp 2\}$ is
given, which improves results of Erdos and Alon.}

of reduced Gram-Schmidt coefficients $(\{\mu_{i,j}\}$, $1\leq j<i\leq n$) is uniformly distributed in
$[0,1)^{\binom n2}$, then the pruned enumeration finds with positive probability a shortest lattice vector. We
demonstrate the power of these algorithms by solving random subset sum problems of arbitrary density with 74

different ways as a sum of $h$ elements of $E$. We give an upper bound for the size of a $B_h[1]$ subset

    $$k \le (m(m!)^2)^{1/h} n^{1/h}+\bigO{n^{1/2h}}.$$
For the case $h=2$ ($h=4$) this has already been proved by Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'{a}n (by Lindstr\"{o}m). It has been
independently proved for all even $h$ by Jia who used an elementary combinatorial argument. Our method uses a
result, which we prove, related to the minimum of dense cosine sums which roughly states that if $1\le
\lambda_1< \dots <\lambda_N\le (2-\epsilon)N$ are $N$ different integers then
    $$ \left| \min_x \sum_1^N \cos \lambda_j x \right| \ge C \epsilon^2 N.$$
Finally we exhibit some dense finite and infinite $B_2[2]$ sequences.}

as $x=j\sb 1+j\sb 2+\cdots+j\sb g$, where the $j$'s belong to the set $B\sb h(g)$. The main result is the
inequality $k<(m(m!)\sp 2n)\sp {1/h}+O(n\sp {1/m})$, where $h=2m$. This result generalizes previous results of

\mathreview{Mihail N. Kolountzakis}{This paper provides a survey (as well as a collection of open problems) of
some additive number-theoretic problems about general sets. This means that the sets involved are arbitrary
sets of positive integers without any presupposed structure such as primes, or $k$th powers. In particular,
this survey does not talk about such problems as Waring's problem or the Goldbach conjecture.

Let $A$ be a set of positive integers and write $r\sb 1(n) = r\sb {A,1}(n)$ for the number of
representations of the integer $n$ as a sum $a+b$, with $a,b \in A$. Write also $r\sb 2(n)$ for the same
quantity but without distinguishing between the representations $a+b$ and $b+a$.

In the first part (${\S}3$) the authors discuss the Erd\H{o}s-Fuchs theorem, which states that for any $A$ the
relation $\sum\sb {n\le N} r\sb 1(n) = C N + o(N\sp {1/4}\log\sp {-1/2}N)$ is impossible. Various sharpenings
of this are presented as well as other results which are similar in flavor, namely results that state that
the sum $\sum\sb {n\le N} r\sb 1(n)$ cannot behave too regularly.

In ${\S}4$ problems and results related to a famous unproved conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Turan are discussed.
This conjecture states that, if $r\sb 1(n) > 0$, then eventually $\limsup\sb n r\sb 1(n) = \infty$ (this is
its weakest form). In this section some new results of the authors are presented along with the survey.

In ${\S}5$ Sidon sets (or $B\sb 2[1]$ sets) along with $B\sb 2[g]$ sets are discussed. A set is of type
$B\sb 2[g]$ if $r\sb 2(n) \le g$ for all $n$. Various results and problems regarding mainly the size of
such (finite and infinite) sets are given.

Difference sets are discussed in ${\S}6$. A set of positive integers $B$ is the difference set of a set $A$
if it is equal to all the positive differences one can form from $A$. The main question here is which
sets $B$ are difference sets. Several more general problems are posed in ${\S}7$, and in ${\S}8$ the
probabilistic method is lightly touched upon. The survey contains an excellent collection of very
interesting problems in the field.

Sometimes the numbers of the citations mentioned in the text do not correspond to the list at the end of
the paper, and some references [e.g., P. Erdos and R. Freud, Mat. Lapok 1 (1991), 1--44; per bibl.] are
hard to find.}

\authorsabstract{Spherical t-designs are Chebyshev-type averaging sets on the $d$-sphere $S^{d}\subset R^{d+1}$ which are
exact for polynomials of degree at most $t$. This concept was introduced in 1977 by Delsarte, Goethals, and
Seidel, who also found the minimum possible size of such designs, in particular, that the number of points in a
3-design on $S^d$ must be at least $n\geq 2d+2$. In this paper we give explicit constructions for spherical
3-designs on $S^d$ consisting of $n$ points for $d=1$ and $n\geq 4$; $d=2$ and $n=6, 8, \geq 10$; $d=3$ and
$n=8, \geq 10$; $d=4$ and $n=10, 12, \geq 14$; $d\geq 5$ and $n\geq 5(d+1)/2$ odd or $n\geq 2d+2$ even. We also
provide some evidence that 3-designs of other sizes do not exist. We will introduce and apply a concept from
additive number theory generalizing the classical Sidon-sequences. Namely, we study sets of integers $S$ for
which the congruence ${\varepsilon }_1x_1+{\varepsilon }_2x_2+\cdots+{\varepsilon }_t x_t\equiv 0$ mod n, where
${\varepsilon }_i=0, \ \pm 1$ and $x_i\in S$ $(i=1, 2, \ldots, t)$, only holds in the trivial cases. We call
such sets Sidon-type sets of strength $t$, and denote their maximum cardinality by $s(n, t)$. We find a lower
bound for $s(n, 3)$, and show how Sidon-type sets of strength 3 can be used to construct spherical 3-designs.
We also conjecture that our lower bound gives the true value of $s(n, 3)$ (this has been verified for $n\le
125$).}

\mathreview{Georges Grekos}{An addition set with parameters $n,k,h,\lambda$ is a subset $A=\{a\sb 1,\cdots,a\sb
k\}$ of $\mathbf Z/n\mathbf Z$ such that for each $m\in\mathbf Z/n\mathbf Z$, $m\neq 0$, the equation (1)
$m=a\sb {i\sb 1}+\cdots+a\sb {i\sb h}$, $i\sb 1\leq\cdots\leq i\sb h$, has $\lambda$ solutions. A variant is to
require in (1) that $i\sb 1<\cdots<i\sb h$. Then $A$ is called a perfect addition set. Addition sets were
studied, for instance, by C. W. H. Lam, S. L. Ma and M. K. Siu [J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 35 (1983), no. 1,
67--78; MR 84m:10053].

A Sidon sequence is a sequence $(a\sb i)$ of positive integers such that for each integer $m\geq 0$, (1)
has at most one solution. The purpose in this short communication is to obtain some nonexistence results
for addition sets having $\lambda=1$, by using results on the number of elements of finite Sidon
sequences.

The idea is interesting but the reader should be warned of the following fact. Analogously to an
addition set for $\mathbf Z/n\mathbf Z$, the authors define an $(n,k,\lambda)$-set [resp., an
$(n,k,\lambda)$-perfect set] of order $h$ as a subset $A=\{a\sb 1,\cdots,a\sb k\}$ of $\mathbf
N=\{0,\cdots,n\}$ such that for each $m\in\mathbf N$, (1) [resp., (1) with the condition $i\sb
1<\cdots<i\sb h$] has exactly $\lambda$ solutions.

In the perfect case, this definition is erroneous, as 0 can never be the sum of distinct elements of
$A$. Nor can 1 be the sum of $h$ distinct elements of $A$ whenever $h\geq 3$, and so on. Further, in the
nonperfect case the definition is clumsy, because for $\lambda\geq 2$ no such set $A$ exists, as neither
0 nor 1 can be the sum of elements of $A$ in two different ways.}

    $$\Bose{2}{p}{\theta}{1}=m \,\Bose{2}{p}{\theta^\prime}{1}-r.$$
In other words, varying the generator does not generate ``new'' Bose sets. (It is easy to extend this to show
the uselessness of varying $k$ in $\Bose{2}{p}{\theta}{k}$.) He also gives a criterion (in terms of $u$ and $v$)
for the existence of a generator $\theta$ satisfying $\theta^2=u\theta+v$. These two results greatly improve the

$B(N)\ll\sqrt{N}$, but it is not known what is the maximal possible growth of the counting function $B(N)$ of
an infinite Sidon set $B$. Improving earlier results, the author constructs an infinite Sidon set $B$ such that
$B(N)=N\sp {\sqrt{2}-1+o(1)}$. The proof is self-contained. The ideas of the construction are summarized by the
author. "Our starting point is the observation that the numbers $\log p$, for $p$ prime, form a Sidon set of
reals. Our plan is to take the binary development of these numbers and rearrange the digits to form a Sidon set
of integers. If the developments were finite (and not too long), this could be done easily. Since the
developments are infinite, we have to round them off. We show that the resulting sequence still almost has the
Sidon property, which enables us to extract a large Sidon subset from it. "Our construction is also random, in
a slightly unusual way. Rather than select individual elements randomly, we choose a random parameter $\alpha$
in the interval $[1,2]$, at the start, which determines a set, and we show that for almost all choices of
$\alpha$ in this interval the set obtained has the required properties."}

\authorsabstract{A subset $\cA$ of the set $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, $|\cA| =k$ is said to form a Sidon (or $B_h$)
sequence $h\ge 2$, if each of the sums $a_1+a_2+\dots + a_h$, $a_1\le a_2 \le \dots \le a_h$; $a_i\in\cA$, are
distinct. We investigate threshold phenomena for the Sidon property, showing that if $\cA_n$ is a random subset
of $[n]$, then the probability that $\cA_n$ is a $B_h$ sequence tends to unity as $n\to\infty$ if $k_n =|\cA_n|
\ll n^{1/2h}$, and that ${\bf P}(\cA_n\text{ is Sidon}) \to 0$ provided that $k_n \gg n^{1/2h}$. The main tool
employed is the Janson exponential inequality. The validity of the Sidon property {\em at} the threshold is
studied as well. We prove, using the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation, that ${\bf P}(\cA_n\text{ is
Sidon}) \to \exp{-\lambda}$ ($n\to \infty$) if $k_n \sim \Lambda \cdot n^{1/2h}$ ($\Lambda \in {\bf R}^+$),
where $\lambda$ is a constant that depends in a well-specified way on $\Lambda$. Multivariate generalizations
are presented.}

\mathreview{Mihail N. Kolountzakis}{The uniform distribution is considered on all $k$-element subsets of
$\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$ and the problem of when a random set $A$ (as above) has the $B_h$ property (i.e., all sums
$a_1+\cdots+a_h$, with $a_i \in A$ and $a_1 \le \cdots \le a_h$, are distinct) is studied. It is known that the
largest $B_h$ subset of $\{1,\cdots,n\}$ is of size $\sim n^{1/h}$. However, it turns out that when we are
choosing random sets we cannot expect that such a large set is $B_h$. In this very clearly written paper it is
proved that when $k = o(n^{1/2h})$ then $A$ is almost surely a $B_h$ set and that when $n^{1/2h} = o(k)$ the
random set $A$ is almost surely not a $B_h$ set. The authors go even further and study the problem at threshold
size $k \sim \Lambda n^{1/2h}$, $\Lambda$ a constant. They prove that in this case (as $n \to \infty$) ${\rm
Prob}(A {\rm is Sidon}) \to e^{-\lambda}$, where $\lambda$ is an explicit function of $\Lambda$.

For the study of the problem away from the threshold the authors use the so-called Janson correlation
inequality, which estimates the probability for the intersection of a collection of events with few
dependencies among them (the proof that a set below the threshold is almost certainly $B_h$ does not
demand this machinery and is a straightforward calculation). At the threshold the Stein-Chen method of
Poisson approximation is used. It is pointed out that either method could have been used for both the
threshold and away-from-threshold problem.}

h(q,\theta)=\{a\vert 1\leq a\leq q\sp h-1, \theta\sp a-\theta\in{\rm GF}(q)\}$ is a $B\sb h$ sequence providing
$\theta$ is a primitive element in the field ${\rm GF}(q\sp h)$. A quadratic polynomial is called primitive
over the field ${\rm GF}(2\sp k)$ if the powers of a root of $p(x)=x\sp 2+ux+v$ give all nonzero elements of
${\rm GF}(2\sp k)$. There exists an algorithm (due to Zhang) which determines a $B\sb 2$ sequence using a root
of $p(x)=x\sp 2-ux+v$. Later this algorithm was improved by the author [Math. Comp. 67 (1998), no. 223,
1173--1178; MR 98m:11012].  As a main result of the present paper the author characterizes primitive quadratics
over ${\rm GF}(2\sp k)$ in terms of coefficients.}

problems of Choi and Erd\"{o}s: For an arbitrary additive group $G$ let $\scr P_n(G)$ denote the set of all subsets
$S$ of $G$ with $n$ elements having the property that 0 is not in $S+S$. Call a subset $A$ of $G$ admissible
with respect to a set $S$ from $\scr P_n(G)$ if the sum of each pair of distinct elements of $A$ lies outside
$S$. Suppose first that $S$ is a subset of the positive integers in the interval $[2n,4n)$. Denote by $f(S)$
the number of elements in a maximum subset of $[n,2n)$ admissible with respect to $S$. S. L. G. Choi [Proc.
London Math. Soc. (3) 23(1971), 629--642; MR 45:1867] showed that $f(n):=\min\{|S|+f(S)\colon
S\subseteq[2n,4n)\}=O(n^{3/4})$. We improve this bound to $O((n\ln n)^{2/3})$. Turning to a problem of Erd\"{o}s,
suppose that $S$ is an element of $\scr P_n(G)$, where $G$ is an arbitrary additive group, and denote by $h(S)$
the maximum cardinality of a subset $A$ of $S$ admissible with respect to $S$. We show that $h(n):=\min\{h(S)|

\authorsabstract{Given a space $\Omega$ endowed with symmetry, we define $ms(\Omega, r)$
to be the maximum of $m$ such that for any $r$-coloring of $\Omega$ there exists a monochromatic symmetric set
of size at least $m$. We consider a wide range of spaces $\Omega$ including the discrete and continuous
segments $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ and $[0,1]$ with central symmetry, geometric figures with the usual symmetries of
Euclidean space, and Abelian groups with a natural notion of central symmetry. We observe that $ms(\{1, \ldots,
n\}, r)$ and $ms([0,1], r)$ are closely related, prove lower and upper bounds for $ms([0,1], 2)$, and find
asymptotics of $ms([0,1], r)$ for $r$ increasing. The exact value of $ms(\Omega, r)$ is determined for figures
of revolution, regular polygons, and multi-dimensional parallelopipeds. We also discuss problems of a slightly
different flavor and, in particular, prove that the minimal $r$ such that there exists an $r$-coloring of the
$k$-dimensional integer grid without infinite monochromatic symmetric subsets is $k+1$.}

\mathreview{Martin Klazar}{What size of a monochromatic symmetric set can one always guarantee, if elements of
a space endowed with measure and symmetry are colored by $r$ colors? To give some answers, the authors use this
general framework: $(\Omega,)$ is a probability space; ${\scr S}$ is a set of symmetries of $\Omega$
(one-to-one, measurable, and measure-preserving mappings $s\colon \Omega\rightarrow\Omega$); $B\subset\Omega$
is symmetric if $s(B)=B$ for an $s\in{\scr S}; {\rm ms}(A)$ is, for $A\subset\Omega$, $\sup((B)\colon B\subset
A)$, where the $B$ are symmetric and measurable; and, finally, ${\rm ms}(\Omega,r)=\inf_{\chi}\max_{i\le r}{\rm
ms}(\chi^{-1}(i))$, where $\chi\colon\Omega\to[r]$ is a measurable coloring.

This interesting half-survey article (the reader is often referred for proofs to other articles) discusses
the following situations. (1) Consider the discrete segment $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with counting measure
$(X)=|X|/n$ and continuous segment $[0,1]$ with Lebesgue measure. ${\scr S}$ consists of central symmetries
$s(x)=g-x$. The results are as follows: $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\rm ms}([n],r)={\rm ms}([0,1],r)$;\break
$(4+\sqrt{6})^{-1}\le {\rm ms}([0,1],2)\le 5/24$; and ${\rm ms}([0,1],r)\sim cr^{-2}$ (where $1/2\le c\le
5/6$). (2) Consider a finite abelian group $G=(Z_n,+)$ with counting measure and $G=( R/ Z,+)$ with Lebesgue
measure. ${\scr S}$ consists of central symmetries $s(x)=2g-x$ and ${\scr S}_+$ of extended symmetries
$s(x)=g-x$ ($g\in G$). Results: $r^{-2}\le{\rm ms}(Z_n,r)\le{\rm ms}_+(Z_n,r)\le r^{-2}+o_r(1)$ (moreover,
${\rm ms}_+(Z_n,r)>r^{-2}$); ${\rm ms}( R/ Z,r)=r^{-2}$ (here ${\scr S}={\scr S}_+$); and some results on
arbitrary compact abelian $G$ ($$ is then Haar measure). (3) Consider geometric figures, especially the ball
$V^k$ and sphere $S^{k-1}$ in $ R^k$, with normed Lebesgue measure. ${\scr S}$ consists of non-identical
isometries leaving $\Omega$ invariant. Some results: For $\Omega=V^k,S^{k-1}$ we have ${\rm
ms}(\Omega,r)=r^{-2}$; the disc $V^2$ can be $r$-colored so that $(A)\le r^{-2}$ for every monochromatic
symmetric subset. Some results on figures with a finite number of symmetries are given (without proofs). (4)
It is proved that the minimum $r$ for which $\chi\colon Z^k\rightarrow [r]$ exists without infinite
monochromatic symmetric set (symmetries here are $s(x)=g-x$) is $k+1$. The bound $r\le k+1$ is shown by a
simple construction and $r>k$ is proved by the Borsuk-Ulam antipodal theorem. A general version of this
question for infinite abelian groups is given and is related to the generalized continuum hypothesis. 14 open
problems are posed.}

$I\subset[1,N]$ of length $cN$ contains $c|\cA|+E_I$ elements of $\cA$, with $|E_I| \le 52 N^{1/4}(1+c^{1/2}
N^{1/8})(1+L_+^{1/2}) N^{-1/8}$, $L_+ = \max\{0,L\}$. In particular, if $|A|=N^{1/2}+\bigO{N^{1/4}}$, and

condition, the exponent $3/4$ is sharp.}

\mathreview{Mihail N. Kolountzakis}{A finite sequence $A$ of positive integers is called a Sidon set if all
sums one can form with two elements of $A$ are distinct except for the trivial coincidences. (This is
equivalent to all differences of two elements of $A$ being distinct.) It has long been known that the largest
Sidon subset of $[1,N]$ has size $\sim N^{1/2}$, and that such sets, which satisfy this asymptotic upper bound,
must be rather regular both in terms of their distribution modulo some (small) residue and in terms of being
"uniformly distributed" in the interval $[1,N]$.

As the author points out, a result claiming uniform distribution implies an upper bound on the maximum gap
such a set may have. The author gives an improved uniform distribution result which implies an improved (and
best possible, in the extreme cases at least) upper bound for the maximum gap.

The improved uniform distribution result claims that if $A \subseteq [1,N]$ is a Sidon set with $N^{1/2}-L$
elements and $I$ is a subinterval of $[1,N]$ of size $cN$ then $$ | c|A| - |A\cap I| | \le 52 N^{1/4}
(1+\sqrt c N^{1/8}) (1+(L^+)^{1/2}N^{-1/8}). $$ The improved upper bound on the maximum gap implied by this
is $C N^{6/8}$, whereas the previously known upper bound was $C N^{7/8}$.}

\mathreview{Alain Plagne}{This paper is concerned with additive number theory in $\bold Z/p\bold Z$. A
well-known theorem of A. L. Cauchy [J. \'{E}cole Polytech.  9 (1813), 99--123], rediscovered by H. Davenport [J.
London Math. Soc.  10 (1935), 30--32; Zbl 010.38905], states that for any $S,T\subset\bold Z/p\bold Z$, the
following holds: $|S+T|\geq \min(p,|S|+|T|-1)$. A. G. Vosper's theorem [J. London Math. Soc.  31 (1956),
200--205; MR 17, 1056c] is a characterization of those $S,T$ such that equality holds in the Cauchy-Davenport
theorem.

Y. O. Hamidoune generalized Vosper's result in several directions. He obtained [J. Algebra 179 (1996), no. 2,
622--630; MR 96m:20034] a result valid in more general groups than $\bold Z/p\bold Z$. To prove this, he
developed the so-called isoperimetric method, for which he defined important tools such as $k$-isoperimetric
numbers, $k$-critical sets and $k$-atoms (a terminology coming from graph theory).

Also, in the case of $\bold Z/p\bold Z$, Hamidoune and {\O}. J. R{\o}dseth [Acta Arith. 92 (2000), no. 3, 251--262;
MR 2001c:11114] went a step further than Vosper by characterizing completely those sets $S,T$ such that
$|S+T|=|S|+|T|$.

Let us mention that there is also a result by G. A. Fre\u\i man [ Elements of a structural theory of set
addition (Russian), Kazan. Gosudarstv. Ped. Inst, 1966; MR 50:12943; English translation; MR 50:12944], in
the case $S=T$ only, which describes the situation up to $|S+S|=12|S|/5-4$.

In the paper under review, the authors partially (the atomic part only) generalize Hamidoune and R{\o}dseth's
result by giving (Theorem 6) necessary conditions that must be satisfied by sets $S,T$ such that $|S+T|\leq
|S|+|T|+m$ for some given integer $m$. Under the (best possible) cardinality condition $2\leq |S|,
|T|<p-(m+4)(m+3)/2$, each of these sets is shown to be the union of at most $m+2$ arithmetic progressions
with the same difference. Let us mention that it could be desirable to show that these differences are in
fact the same for $S$ and $T$ (which is not proved in the present paper).

The methodology is taken from Hamidoune's paper [op. cit.]. More precisely, beginning with Proposition 2.5 of
that paper, 2-atoms are very carefully studied. Next, surjective pairs, which are a way to express structure,
are introduced. Roughly speaking, the point is that, in the present situation, 2-atoms with at least 3
elements define surjective pairs, a case which leads to a contradiction. Thus 2-atoms contain precisely 2
elements: this gives the structure.

Let us finish the review of this nice paper by informing the reader that some definitions here are different
from Hamidoune's. What the authors call $k$-isoperimetric connectivity and $k$-fragment are called by
Hamidoune $k$-isoperimetric number and $k$-critical set, respectively. Also, what Serra and Z\'{e}mor call
$k$-isoperimetric number is something which was not introduced by Hamidoune.}

\mathreview{V. Siva Rama Prasad}{A sequence of positive integers $A\colon 1<\alpha_1<\alpha_2<\dots$ with the
property that all the differences $\alpha_j-\alpha_i, i<j$, are distinct is called a $B_2$-sequence. Denote
their reciprocal sum by $\sigma(A)$; that is, $\sigma(A)=\sum\alpha^{-1}_i$. The maximum of $\sigma(A)$, where
$A$ ranges over all possible $B_2$-sequences, is called the distinct difference constant (DDC). Previously it
was known that $(*) 2.1597<\rm DDC<2.374$.

The Mian-Chowla sequence~\cite{1944.Chowla.Mian} obtained by the stingy algorithm is an optimal $B_2$-sequence.
Recently Z. X. Zhang~\cite{1993.Zhang} has disproved the conjecture: the Mian-Chowla sequence is a
$B_2$-sequence achieving the DDC. Therefore, determining some $B_2$-sequence which attains the DDC is still an
open problem.

In the present paper the authors estimate bounds sharper than in $(*)$ on the DDC: $2.1600383<\rm
DDC<2.2473$. They also prove that the first three terms of any $B_2$-sequence achieving the DDC should
be 1, 2, 4. }

\annotation{This paper contains a substantial jump in sophisticatedness-of-technique over essentially all
earlier work on the density of finite \Bhg{h}{g} sets. The techniques used in
\cite{2002.Cilleruelo.Ruzsa.Trujillo} to get upper bounds are incorporated and extended.

The central problem here is to bound
    $$\underline{M}(n) := \inf_{f:[n]\to\R,\sum f(x)=n} \sum_{a+b=c+d} f(a)f(b)f(c)f(d).$$
As the summation has 3 degrees of freedom, it is not surprising that there are positive constants $c_1,c_2$
with $c_1n^3 \lesssim \underline{M}(n) \lesssim c_2n^3$. Green shows that we may take $c_1=4/7$ and
$c_2=0.64074$. He also shows that the infimum is obtained for a unique function $f$, and $(f\circ f)\circ f(x)$
is constant for $x\in[n]$.

A substantive amount of additional work gives the bounds
    \begin{align*}
    \sigma_3 &\le (7/2)^{1/3} < 1.519 \\
    \sigma_4 &\le 7^{1/4} < 1.627  \\
    \sigma_{2h}((2h)!) &\le \pi^{1/2}h^{1/2}(h!)^2(1+\epsilon(h))/((2h)!) \\
    \sigma_{2h-1}((2h-1)!) &\le  \pi^{1/2}h^{-1/2}(h!)^2(1+\epsilon(h))/((2h-1)!) .
    \end{align*}
The function $\epsilon(h)$ tends to 0 as $h\to\infty$, but it is not computed explicitly. Also, Green shows that
$\sigma_2(g) \le 7/4(1-1/g)$ and $\sigma_2(g) \le 1.6999$.

While the main theorems are proven in full detail, but there are number of comments about generalizations that
are neither proven nor straightforward.}


\mathreview{Mihail N. Kolountzakis}{From the introduction: "In this paper we investigate the problem of
minimizing, over all functions $f\colon \{1,\dots,N\}\to  R$ with $\sum_x f(x) = N$, the quantity $$ M(f) =
\sum_{a+b=c+d} f(a)f(b)f(c)f(d). $$ We obtain a nontrivial lower bound for $M(f)$ using techniques from Fourier
analysis. We then demonstrate the relevance of this bound to upper bounds for $B_h[g]$ sets."

A $B_h[g]$ set is a set $A$ of integers such that every integer is represented at most $g$ times as an
$h$-fold sum of elements of $A$, not counting as different representations that differ only in the order of
the summands.

In this paper several upper bounds are improved. For example, if $A \subseteq \{1,\dots,N\}$ is a $B_3[1]$
set then $|A| \le (7/2)^{1/3} N^{1/3} (1+o(1))$, and when $A$ is a $B_4[1]$ subset of $\{1,\dots,N\}$ it is
proved here that $|A| \le 7^{1/4} N^{1/4} (1+o(1))$.

This is a very well written paper with very interesting technique.}

\mathreview{Ben Joseph Green}{Let $g \geq 1$ and $h \geq 2$ be integers. A subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$
is said to be a $B_h[g]$ set if the number of solutions to the equation $a_1 + \dots + a_h = x$, $a_i \in A$,
is never more than $g$ for any $x \in G$. Solutions which differ only in the order of the summands are
considered the same.

In the case $g = 1$, $h = 2$ one has what is more commonly referred to as a Sidon set.

In the last two or three years there have been numerous results concerning the maximal size of a subset of
$\{1,\dots,N\}$ with the $B_h[g]$ property, and this article performs the very useful function of surveying
this body of work.

The simplest unsolved problem is that of determining the size of the largest $B_2[2]$ subset of
$\{1,\dots,N\}$. Writing $A(2,2)$ for the cardinality of such a set it is known that $1.5118\sqrt{N} \leq
A(2,2) \leq 2.2913\sqrt{N}$, the lower bound being a result of the author and L. Habsieger and the upper
bound a result of the reviewer. It seems to be a challenging open problem to narrow the gap here, and an even
harder task to determine $A(2,2)$ asymptotically.

This survey is well written and accurate, though the reviewer does not agree with all of the speculations the
author makes. For example, he does not believe that there is much to be gained from trying to combine the many
recent approaches to the problem of finding upper bounds (purely combinatorial, probabilistic and analytic)
because these all seem to rest on exploiting the fact that $\{1,\dots,N\}$ is not closed under addition. A true
understanding of $B_2[2]$ sets would require a technique which said something about the corresponding questions
in $\Z/N\Z$, which the recent papers do not touch.

The researcher in this area may also be interested in an as yet unpublished work of K. O'Bryant entitled ``A
complete annotated bibliography of work related to Sidon sequences''.}

\annotation{This nine page article inaugurated the modern era of Sidon-set research, containing significant
advances in dealing with both $g$ and $h$ in getting both upper and lower bounds. In many cases, this was the
first progress over the trivial bounds. The results here have all received substantial further refinement and
generalization. We note that this article was submitted 31 months before publication, and the preprint was
influencing other workers as early as 2000.

They prove that $R_2(2g,n) \le 1.319(2gn)^{1/2}+1$ and, whence $\sigma_2(2g) \le 1.319$. They prove that
$\sigma_2(2g) \ge \frac{g+\floor{g/2}}{\sqrt{g^2+2g\floor{g/2}}}$, whence $\sigma_2(4) \ge \sqrt{3/2}>1.224$.
For $h>2$, they prove that $R_h(h!g,n) \le \frac{(h(h!)^2gN)^{1/h}}{(1+\cos^h(\pi/h))^{1/h}}$, whence
$$\sigma_h(h!g)^h \le  \frac{h(h!)^2}{1+\cos^h(\pi/h)}.$$}

It is a well known fact that the ratio $F_2(N, 2)/\sqrt{N}$ ($N\ge1$) is bounded from below and from above by
two positive constants. However, one still ignores whether this quantity has a limit as $N$ tends toward
infinity. This explains the huge amount of work that was produced in order to improve the best lower and upper
asymptotic bounds for $F_2(N, 2)/\sqrt{N}$. In this paper, we obtain the following asymptotic bounds
$$\frac{4}{\sqrt{7}} \lesssim \frac{F_2(N,2)}{\sqrt{N}} < 2.3218\ldots.$$}

representations as $a + a'$, two such representations being counted as the same if they differ only in the

From the abstract: "Let $F_2(N,2)$ denote the maximal cardinality of any $B_2[2]$ set included in
$\{1,2,\dots,N\}$. It is a well-known fact that the ratio $F_2(N,2)/\sqrt{N}$ $(N\geq 1)$ is bounded from

In this carefully written paper, the bounds $1.5119 \leq F_2(N,2)/\sqrt{N} \leq 2.3218$, valid for large $N$,
are given. As noted by the authors the superior bound $F_2(N,2)/\sqrt{N} \leq 2.2912$ was obtained earlier by
the reviewer~\cite{2001.Green}.

The authors state that their methods (which are combinatorial and make use of linear programming) are rather
different from those of the reviewer's paper and that as such there is hope of combining the two approaches
to give a better bound. Whether or not this is the case remains to be seen.}

\mathreview{Ben Joseph Green}{Let $m$ be a positive integer, and write $Z_m$ for the group of residues modulo
$m$. A set $S \subseteq Z_m$ is said to be Sidon if the only solutions to $s_1 + s_2 = s_3 + s_4$ with $s_i \in
S$ are the trivial ones with $\{s_1,s_2\}= \{s_3,s_4\}$.

It is easy to see that if $S$ is Sidon then $|S| \leq \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{m - \frac{3}{4}}$. In this paper
the author shows that Sidon sets which have nearly maximal size are well distributed in arithmetic
progressions. To be precise, define the defect $\omega$ of $S$ to be $\sqrt{m} + 1 - |S|$. Then if $I =
\{a,a+1,\dots,a+l-1\}$ is any interval of length $l$ we have the estimate $$ \left| |S \cap I| -
\frac{|S|l}{m}\right| \leq \sqrt{2}\omega^{1/2}m^{1/4}\log m.$$ The proof uses some Fourier analysis.
Examples are given which show that, in a certain sense, this result is close to being sharp.

It is interesting to ask whether, for a particular $m$, there must exist large Sidon subsets of $Z_m$. One
has the following examples: $m = q^2 + q + 1$, $|S| = q + 1$ (Singer 1938); $m = q^2 - 1$, $|S| = q$ (Bose
1942); $m = p(p-1)$, $|S| = p - 1$ \ref[I. Z. Ruzsa, Acta Arith. 65 (1993), no. 3, 259--282; MR 94k:11112].
Here $q$ can be any prime power, and $p$ any prime.

With these examples alone, we cannot at present prove that there are infinitely many primes $p$ together with
Sidon subsets $S_p \subseteq Z_p$ such that $|S_p| = \sqrt{p}(1 - o(1))$. This would seem to be an
interesting open problem in the area.}

\authorsabstract{The study of graph labellings has focused on finding classes of graphs which admit a
particualr type of labelling. Here we consider variations of the well-known edge-magic and vertex-magic total
labellings for which all graphs admit such a labelling. In particular, we consider two types of injections of
the vertices and edges of a graph with positive integers: (1) for every edge the sum of its label and those of
its end-vertices is some {\em magic} constant ({\em edge-magic}); and (2) for every vertex the sum of its label
and those of the edges incident to it is some {\em magic} constant ({\em vertex-magic}). Our aim is to minimise
the maximum label or the magic constant associated with the injection. We present upper bounds on these
parameters for complete graphs, forests and arbitrary graphs, which in a number of cases are within a constant
factor of being optimal. Our results are based on greedy algorithms for computing an antimagic injection, which
is then extended to a magic total injection. Of independent interst is our result that every forest has an
edge-antinmagic vertex labelling.}

\mathreview{W. D. Wallis}{A total labelling of a graph is a one-to-one mapping of the set of vertices and edges
of the graph onto the first $n$ integers, where $n$ is the total number of vertices and edges. Such a labelling
is edge-magic with magic constant $k$ if, for every edge, the sum of its label with the labels of its endpoints
equals $k$. Similarly, a labelling is vertex-magic if, for each vertex, the sum of its label with those of its
incident edges equals some magic constant.

Magic injections generalize these concepts: the labels need not be contiguous, but are merely required to be
positive integers. These labellings are of interest in their own right and in constructing magic labellings.

One desirable property is that the magic constant be small; similarly for the largest label. In the paper under
review, upper bounds are found for the minimum values of these parameters, for complete graphs, forests, and
arbitrary graphs.}

\authorsabstract{We label the vertices of a given graph $G$ with positive integers so that the pairwise
differences over its edges are all distinct. Let ${\cal D}(G)$ be the smallest value that the largest label can
have.

For example, for the complete graph $K_n$, the labels must form a Sidon set. Hence ${\cal
D}(K_n)=(1+\littleo{1})n^2$. Rather surprisingly, we demonstrate that there are gaphs with only
$n^{3/2+\littleo{1}}$ edges achieving this bound.

More generally, we study the maximum value of ${\cal D}(G)$ that a graph $G$ of the given order $n$ and size
$m$ can have. We obtain bounds which are sharp up to a logarithmic multiplicative factor. The analogous problem
for pairwise sums is considered as well. Our results, in particular, disprove a conjecture of Wood.}

\authorsabstract{A symmetric subset of the reals is one that remains invariant under some reflection
$x\mapsto c-x$. Given $0<\epsilon\le1$, there exists a real number $\Delta(\epsilon)$ with the following
property: if $0\le\delta<\Delta(\epsilon)$, then every subset of $[0,1]$ with measure $\epsilon$ contains a
symmetric subset with measure $\delta$, while if $\delta>\Delta(\epsilon)$, then there exists a subset of
$[0,1]$ with measure $\epsilon$ that does not contain a symmetric subset with measure $\delta$. In this paper
we establish upper and lower bounds for $\Delta(\epsilon)$ of the same order of magnitude: for example, we
prove that $\Delta(\epsilon)=2\epsilon-1$ for $\frac{11}{16}\le\epsilon\le1$ and that
$0.59\epsilon^2<\Delta(\epsilon)<0.8\epsilon^2$ for $0<\epsilon\le\frac{11}{16}$.

This continuous problem is intimately connected with a corresponding discrete problem. A set $S$ of integers is
called a $\Bhg{}{g}$ set if for any given $m$ there are at most $g$ ordered pairs $(s_1,s_2)\in S \times S$
with $s_1+s_2=m$; in the case $g=2$, these are better known as Sidon sets. We also establish upper and lower
bounds of the same order of magnitude for the maximal possible size of a $\Bhg{}{g}$ set contained in
$\{1,\dots,n\}$, which we denote by $R(g,n)$. For example, we prove that $R(g,n)<1.31\sqrt{gn}$ for all $n\ge
g\ge2$, while $R(g,n) > 0.79\sqrt{gn}$ for sufficiently large integers $g$ and $n$.

These two problems are so interconnected that both continuous and discrete tools can be applied to each problem
with surprising effectiveness. The harmonic analysis methods and inequalities among various $L^p$ norms we use
to derive lower bounds for $\Delta(\epsilon)$ also provide uniform upper bounds for $R(g,n)$, while the
techniques from combinatorial and probabilistic number theory that we employ to obtain constructions of large
\Bhg{}{g} sets yield strong upper bounds for $\Delta(\epsilon)$.}

\authorsabstract{We give explicit constructions of sets $S$ with the property that for each integer $k$, there are at most $g$
solutions to $k=s_1+s_2, a_i\in S$; such sets are called Sidon sets if $g=2$ and generalized Sidon sets if
$g\ge 3$. We extend to generalized Sidon sets the Sidon-set constructions of Singer, Bose, and Ruzsa. We also
further optimize Koulantzakis' idea of interleaving several copies of a Sidon set, extending the improvements
of Cilleruelo \& Ruzsa \& Trujillo, Jia, and Habsieger \& Plagne.}

\authorsabstract{It is proved that almost all small subsets of $[n]$ are $B_2[g]$ sets, in the sense that if
$B_2[g](k,n)$ denotes the number of $B_2[g]$ sets of cardinality $k$ contained in the interval $[n]$, then
$\lim_{n\to\infty} B_2[g](k,n)/\tbinom{n}{k}=1$ if $k=\littleo{n^{g/(2g+2)}}$.}

\authorsabstract{A graph $G$ of ornder $n$ and size $m$ is {\em edge-magic} if there is a bijection $\ell\colon
V(G) \cup E(G) \to [n+m]$ such that all sums $\ell(a)+\ell(b)+\ell(ab)$, $ab\in E(G)$, are the same. We present
new lower and upper bounds on ${\cal M}(n)$, the maximum size of an edge-magic graph of order $n$, being the
first to show an upper bound of the form ${\cal M}(n)\le (1-\epsilon)\binom{n}{2}$. Concrete estimates for
$\epsilon$ can be obtained by knowing $s(k,n)$, the maximum number of distinct pairwise sums that a $k$-subset
of $[n]$ can have.

So, we also study $s(k,n)$, motivated by the above connections to edge-magic graphs and by the fact that a few
known functions from additive number theory can be expressed via $s(k,n)$. For example, our estimate $$s(k,n)
\le n+k^2\left(\frac 14-\frac{1}{(\pi+2)^2} + \littleo{1}\right)$$ implies new bounds on the maximum size of
quasi-Sidon sets, a problem pose by Erd\H{o}s and Freud~\cite{1991.Erdos.Freud}. The related problem for
differences is considered as well.}
